      Each U-shaped conductor segment has two in-slot portions inserted into a pair of slots, and four in-slot portions are disposed in each slot.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, four connection ends extend from each slot to be welded to form a stator winding.
      <br/>
      Because all the connection ends are aligned in the circular layer, the interval between welded junctions of the connection ends becomes so small that insulation between the junctions becomes difficult, and that cooling air can not pass therethrough very well.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="11">The invention is described with reference to the appended drawings.</p>
    <p num="12">As shown in FIG. 1, a vehicle AC generator 1 includes stator 2, rotor 3, frame 4 and rectifier 5.</p>
    <p num="13">Stator 2 includes stator core 22, a stator winding composed of a plurality of conductor segments 23, and a plurality of insulators 24 disposed between stator core and each of conductor segments 23.</p>
    <p num="14">
      Rotor 3 includes, shaft 6, a pair of front and rear pole cores 7 and a cylindrically wound field coil 8.
      <br/>
      One pole core 7 has six claw poles extending to interleave with six claw poles of the other pole core 7, thereby enclosing field coil 8.
      <br/>
      Front pole core 7 has mixed flow cooling fan 11 welded to the front surface thereof, and rear pole core 7 has centrifugal cooling fan 12 welded to the rear surface thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Frame 4 accommodates stator 2 and rotor 3 so that rotor 3 can rotate with shaft 6 within the inner periphery of stator core 22.
      <br/>
      Frame 4 has a plurality of air-discharge windows 42 at portions thereof surrounding the coil-ends of the stator winding, and a plurality of air-intake windows 41 at the radially inner portions of the opposite ends thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="16">AC generator 1 is driven by an engine through a belt (not shown) and pulley 20 which is carried by the front end of shaft 6.</p>
    <p num="17">
      When field coil 8 is energized by an outside battery (not shown), the claw poles are polarized to supply magnetic flux to the stator winding, thereby generating AC output power.
      <br/>
      Rectifier 5 converts the AC output power to DC power.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As shown in FIG. 2, conductor segments 23 are formed to a plurality of sets of U-shaped large and small segments 231 and 232.
      <br/>
      Large segment 231 has a pair of in-slot portions 231a and 231b, a pair of connection-ends 231d and 231e respectively extending from the pair of in-slot portions 231a and 231b through outwardly inclined coil-end portions 231g, and turn portion 231c.
      <br/>
      Small segment 232 has a pair of in-slot portions 232a and 232b, a pair of connection-ends 232d and 232e respectively extending from the pair of in-slot portions 232a, 232b through inwardly inclined coil-end portions 232g, and turn portion 232c.
      <br/>
      Turn portion 231c of large segment 231 surrounds turn portion 232c of small segment 232 at the lower axial end of stator core 22, and coil-end portions 231g of large segment 231 are longer than coil-end portions 232g of small segments 232.
      <br/>
      It is also possible that coil-end portions 231g are made shorter than coil-end porions 232g.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      One in-slot portion 231a of large segment 231 is disposed in the radially innermost layer of one slot 25, and the other in-slot portion 231b of the same segment 231 is disposed in the radially outermost layer of another slot 25 which is one pole-pitch spaced apart therefrom in the clockwise direction.
      <br/>
      One in-slot portion 232a of small segment 232 is disposed in the radially inner middle layer of the same slot as in-slot portion 231a, and the other in-slot portion 232b of the same segment 232 is disposed in the radially outer middle layer of the same slot as in-slot portion 231b.
    </p>
    <p num="20">As shown in FIG. 3, in-slot portions 231a and 231b' of two large U-shaped conductor segments 231 and 231' and in-slot portions 232a and 232b' of two small conductor segments 232 and 232' are inserted into one slot 25 in radially aligned four layers.</p>
    <p num="21">
      As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, connection-end 231d' is positioned in the radially innermost circular layer formed at the upper axial end of stator core 22.
      <br/>
      Connection-end 231d' is also positioned at an apex of a scalene triangle formed of counterclockwise or left inclined longer coil-end portion 231g' extending from in-slot portion 231a as one side, which is inserted in the radially innermost slot-layer of one slot 25, and clockwise or right inclined shorter coil-end portion 232g extending from in-slot portion 232a as the other side, which is inserted in the inner middle slot-layer of another slot 25 that is one-pole pitch spaced apart from the one slot.
      <br/>
      Connection-end 232d is positioned in the inner middle circular layer at the same apex as connection-end 231d' to be in contact therewith to form an inner junction 233a.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Connection-end 232e is positioned in the outer middle circular layer formed at the same axial end at an apex of a scalene triangle having counterclockwise inclined shorter coil-end portion 232g extending from in-slot portion 232b inserted in the outer middle slot-layer of the one slot as one side and clockwise inclined longer coil-end portion 231g' extending from in-slot portion 231b' inserted in the outermost slot-layer of the another slot 25 as the other side.
      <br/>
      Connection-end 231e' is positioned in the outermost circular layer at the same apex as connection-end 232e to be in contact therewith to form an outer junction 233b.
      <br/>
      Thus the above two apexes are spaced apart from each other both in the radial direction and circumferential directions.
    </p>
    <p num="23">Connection-ends 231d' and 232d on the same apex are welded together to form a first junction 233a, and connection ends 232e and 231e' on the same apex are welded together to form a second junction 233b that is spaced apart from the first junction 233a, so that two large segment 231 and 231' are series connected by small segment 232.</p>
    <p num="24">
      All the sets of U-shaped large and small segments 231 and 232 are inserted, arranged and welded in the same manner as described above to form the stator winding.
      <br/>
      Thus, a plurality of junctions 233a and also a plurality of junctions 233b are respectively disposed in two concentric circular layers.
      <br/>
      The plurality of first junctions 233a and the plurality of second junctions 233b are shifted circumferentially from one another so that each of first junctions 233a can be disposed between two of second junctions 233b.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Because all the junctions, 233a, 233b are disposed in two circular layers and circumferentially spaced apart from one another, not only cooling air can pass between the coil-end portion easily but welding process can be carried out efficiently as shown in FIG. 6, where two or more welders C1 and C2, such as tungsten inert gas welders, can be used.</p>
    <p num="26">
      The U-shaped segments shown in FIG. 2 can be substituted by segments having one in-slot portion and a pair of connection-ends formed at the opposite ends thereof as shown in FIG. 7.
      <br/>
      The lower connection-end can be formed after it is inserted into the slot as shown by dotted lines.
      <br/>
      The coil-end portion disposed in the outermost and the innermost circular layers are longer or shorter than the coil-end portions disposed in the outer middle and inner middle circular layers to have the circumferential spaces between the junctions of the connection portions.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Each set of conductor segments 23 can be composed of three kinds of U-shaped segments, large, medium, and small segments.
      <br/>
      The stator winding can be formed substantially in the same manner as the above.
      <br/>
      In such a case, junctions 233a, 233b, 233c are respectively distributed in three circular layers or lines r1, r2, r3 at an axial end of the stator core as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      In the foregoing description of the present invention, the invention has been disclosed with reference to specific embodiments thereof.
      <br/>
      It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to the specific embodiments of the present invention without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the description of the present invention in this document is to be regarded in an illustrative, rather than restrictive, sense.
