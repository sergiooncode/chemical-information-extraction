      The invention relates in particular to a starting device for a high-pressure discharge lamp, for example a low-wattage halogen metal vapour high-pressure discharge lamp for a motor vehicle headlamp.
      <br/>
      The high-pressure discharge lamp has a discharge vessel which is sealed in a gastight fashion.
      <br/>
      Projecting into the discharge space are two gas discharge electrodes which are connected in an electrically conducting fashion to external supply leads.
      <br/>
      During operation of the discharge lamp, a light-emitting discharge arc is formed between its gas discharge electrodes.
      <br/>
      To operate the lamp, an operating unit is required which supplies the discharge lamp with electric power and limits the discharging current via the discharge arc.
      <br/>
      The operating unit also comprises a starting device for the discharge lamp which initiates the gas discharge.
      <br/>
      In order to start the gas discharge in a high-pressure discharge lamp, a starting voltage of a few kilovolts is required for a cold lamp, while to restart the same lamp when hot--that is to say to start it in the still hot state--a starting voltage of more than 20 kV can be required.
      <br/>
      After starting of the gas discharge lamp has been performed, the operating voltage of the high-pressure discharge lamp drops, that is to say the voltage drop over the discharge path which is required to maintain the discharge arc, to only approximately 80 V to 100 V. The starting device can be constructed, for example, as a pulse starting unit which applies unipolar high-voltage pulses to one of the two gas discharge electrodes of the high-pressure discharge lamp during the starting phase.
    </p>
    <p num="4">II. PRIOR ART</p>
    <p num="5">
      A starting device corresponding to the preamble of Patent Claim 1 is disclosed in the PCT application with the international publication number WO 97/04624.
      <br/>
      This starting device is a pulse starting device for a high-pressure discharge lamp.
      <br/>
      The pulse starting device has a starting transformer with a primary winding and a secondary winding, a starting capacitor, a resistor element via which the starting capacitor is charged, and an automatic switch.
      <br/>
      One terminal of the secondary winding is connected to one of the gas discharge electrodes of the high-pressure discharge lamp, while its other terminal is connected to the voltage input of the starting device.
      <br/>
      The primary winding of the starting transformer and the switching path of the automatic switch are arranged in such a way that the discharging current of the starting capacitor flows through them.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Since the starting voltage required to restart the high-pressure discharge lamp when hot is substantially higher than the voltage present at the voltage input of the starting device, the starting transformer must have an appropriately high transformation ratio.
      <br/>
      As a consequence of the high transformation ratio of the starting transformer, the known and commercially available starting devices have a high space requirement because of the large volume of the starting transformer.
      <br/>
      Consequently, in the case of low-wattage halogen metal vapour high-pressure discharge lamps which are provided for use in motor vehicle headlamps, it is not possible to accommodate the starting device for these lamps in the lamp cap.
    </p>
    <p num="7">III. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p>
    <p num="8">
      It is the object of the invention to provide an improved starting device for a discharge lamp, and an improved method for starting a discharge lamp.
      <br/>
      In particular, the starting device is intended to have as compact a design as possible, so that it can still be accommodated in the lamp cap even in the case of the low-wattage halogen metal vapour high-pressure discharge lamps which are used in motor vehicle headlamps and are of very small design.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      This object is achieved according to the invention by means of the characterizing features of Patent Claim 1 or 13.
      <br/>
      Particularly advantageous embodiments of the invention are described in the subclaims.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      According to the invention, the starting device according to the invention has a transformer which has a parallel circuit, comprising at least two primary windings, and at least one secondary winding, the parallel circuit of the primary windings being inductively coupled to the at least one secondary winding.
      <br/>
      For a given transformation ratio of the transformer, this measure permits the number of turns per unit length on the secondary side of the transformer to be substantially reduced without the inductive coupling between the primary and secondary sides being impaired by the low number of turns per unit length of the primary windings.
      <br/>
      The induced voltage available on the secondary side does not change if the transmission ratio is preserved.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The primary windings have advantageously respectively at most two turns.
      <br/>
      As a result, there is also a reduction in the number of turns per unit length of the at least one secondary winding in accordance with the desired transformation ratio.
      <br/>
      It has emerged that, for example, a transformer with two primary windings, which are connected in parallel and have two turns in each case, has just as good inductive coupling between the primary and secondary sides as a transformer with only one primary winding which has four turns.
      <br/>
      However, for a prescribed transformation ratio of the transformer, only half as many turns are required for the case of the two primary windings which are connected in parallel and respectively have two turns on the secondary side as for the case of the one primary winding with four turns.
      <br/>
      In order to improve still further the inductive coupling between the primary and secondary sides of the transformer, the primary windings connected in parallel can advantageously consist in each case of a copper strip.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      The reduction of the number of turns per unit length on the secondary side permits a compact design of the transformer and of the entire starting device, with the result that all the subassemblies of the starting device, including the transformer, can be accommodated in the lamp cap.
      <br/>
      The expensive electric connections, provided with insulation which is proof against high voltage, between the lamp holder and the starting unit are thereby eliminated.
      <br/>
      The high-voltage pulses for starting the gas discharge are then generated inside the lamp cap and are therefore no longer accessible from outside.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      It has proved advantageous to use a transformer with a ferrite core and a coil former which has at least one chamber for the transformer windings.
      <br/>
      To avoid electric breakdowns and to prevent eddy currents in the ferrite body, the ferrite core advantageously consists of a high-resistance material, with the result that the ferrite core has an electric resistance of more than 1 M OMEGA .
      <br/>
      It is advantageous to use E cores or cylindrical cores, such as cylinder cores, tubular cores or threaded cores, for example, as ferrite body.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The starting device according to the invention comprises a capacitor, a resistor element, an automatic switch and a transformer with at least two primary windings connected in parallel and at least one secondary winding.
      <br/>
      The components of the starting device are arranged and interconnected in such a way that the capacitor discharges abruptly for starting the gas discharge in the lamp, the discharging current of the capacitor flowing via the parallel circuit of the primary windings and via the switching path of the automatic switch, with the result that the voltage pulses induced in the at least one secondary winding are applied to one of the gas discharge electrodes of the lamp.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In a first preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, the starting device is constructed as an asymmetrical pulse starting device which applies unipolar starting voltage pulses to only one of the lamp electrodes.
      <br/>
      In this starting device, the transformer has only one secondary winding, which is connected to a terminal of the starting voltage output for the discharge lamp.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      In the second, particularly preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, the starting device is designed as a symmetrical pulse starting device which simultaneously applies unipolar starting voltage pulses of opposite polarity to the two gas discharge electrodes of the lamp.
      <br/>
      By contrast with the asymmetric pulse starting device, this mode of operation has the advantage of lower line losses and lesser demands on the electric insulation of the lamp parts conducting high voltage.
      <br/>
      The particularly preferred second exemplary embodiment of the pulse starting device has a transformer with two primary windings which are connected in parallel and through both of which, during the starting phase of the lamp, there flows the discharge current of the capacitor of the starting device, which capacitor discharges in surges via the switching path of the automatic switch, and two secondary windings, which are both inductively coupled to the parallel circuit of the primary windings.
      <br/>
      In each case, the two secondary windings are connected via a terminal of the starting voltage output to a gas discharge electrode of the lamp and are arranged in such a way that unipolar high-voltage pulses of opposite polarity are induced in the two secondary windings by the abovenamed discharging current.
    </p>
    <p num="17">Another solution for the set problem of the invention is described in the characterizing part of Patent Claim 13 and the third exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p num="18">
      In the third exemplary embodiment of the pulse starting device, the transformer belonging to the starting device has a primary winding with at most two turns, which consists according to the invention of a wide metal strip which encloses the at least one secondary winding and advantageously also encloses the ferrite body of the transformer.
      <br/>
      For a given transformation ratio of the transformer, this measure permits the number of turns per unit length on the secondary side of the transformer to be reduced considerably without impairing the inductive coupling between the primary and secondary sides by the low number of turns per unit length of the primary winding.
      <br/>
      It has proved to be advantageous to use a transformer with a ferrite core and a coil former which has at least one chamber for the at least one secondary winding.
      <br/>
      To avoid electric breakdowns and to prevent eddy currents in the ferrite body, the ferrite core advantageously consists of a material which has an electric resistance of more than 1 M OMEGA .
      <br/>
      E cores or cylindrical cores, such as cylinder cores, tubular cores or threaded cores, for example, are advantageously used as ferrite body.

      The circuit diagram of an asymmetrical pulse starting device in accordance with the first exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      This starting device serves to start a gas discharge in a halogen metal vapour high-pressure discharge lamp LP1, which has an electric nominal power of 35 watts and is operated, for example, in a motor vehicle headlamp.
      <br/>
      The starting device comprises a transformer TR1 with two primary windings N10, N11 and a secondary winding N12, a capacitor C1, a resistor element R1, a spark gap F1 and a diode D1.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the starting device has a DC voltage input with a first j10 and a second DC voltage terminal j11, as well as a starting voltage output with a first j12 and a second starting voltage terminal j13.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      At the DC voltage input, the starting device is provided with a DC voltage of approximately 400 V which is generated, for example, by a voltage transformer (not illustrated) from the network voltage of the motor vehicle.
      <br/>
      The DC voltage terminal j10 is at +400 V, and the other DC voltage terminal is at frame potential.
      <br/>
      The positive terminal j10 is connected via a branch point V10 to one terminal of the capacitor C1.
      <br/>
      The other terminal of the capacitor C1 is connected via a further branch point V11 and via the ohmic resistor R1 as well as via the diode D1, poled in the forward direction, to the DC voltage terminal j11, which is at frame potential.
      <br/>
      As a result, a charging current for the capacitor C1 flows via the resistor element R1 and the diode D1, the capacitor C1 thereby being charged to approximately 350 V. The branch point V10 is connected to the start of the secondary winding N12 of the transformer TR1 and to the starts of the primary windings N10, N11, arranged in a parallel circuit, of the transformer TR1.
      <br/>
      The end of the secondary winding N12 is connected to the starting voltage terminal j12 of the starting voltage output which, for its part, is connected to a gas discharge electrode E10 of the lamp LP1 when the lamp LP1 is installed.

    <p num="22">
      The two primary windings N10, N11 of the transformer TR1 are connected in parallel.

      The starts of the transformer windings N10, N11, N12 are marked in FIG. 1 in each case by a point above the corresponding winding.

      The invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiments explained above in more detail.
      <br/>
      For example, in all the exemplary embodiments explained above, it is also possible to use an E core or a ring core or a U-core for the transformer instead of a cylindrical ferrite core.
