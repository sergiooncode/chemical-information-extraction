    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a flat image display device in which electrons emitted from a plurality of cathodes disposed on a cathode board impinge on a phosphor screen coated on an inner surface of a front glass case to display an image.</p>
    <p num="2">
      FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view schematically showing a conventional flat image display device.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the conventional image display device comprises a front glass case 21 having a phosphor screen 22 on an inner surface thereof and a rear case 23.
      <br/>
      The front glass case 21 and the rear case 23 are hermetically sealed by frit glass at a sealing portion 25.
      <br/>
      Within an airtight chamber 24 are provided a cathode board 26 having cathodes facing the phosphor screen 22 for emitting electrons and a collector electrode 27 for collecting electrons emitted from the cathodes.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, the electrode board 26 is supported by a plurality of support columns 28 fixed to the inner surface of the rear case 23 to face the phosphor screen 22.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      FIG. 5 is an enlarged cross sectional view schematically showing a broken line part 30 of FIG. 4.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, a reference numeral 31 denotes a cathode (for instance, a conical cathode) for emitting electrons.
      <br/>
      A plurality of cathodes are orderly arranged in matrix form so that the cathodes correspond to the phosphor dots composing the phosphor surface 22.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 5, a reference numeral 32 denotes a cathode electrode for applying a voltage to the cathodes 41, a reference numeral 33 denotes an insulating layer, and a reference numeral 34 denotes a gate electrode.
      <br/>
      Although the cathodes 31 in FIG. 5 are field emission type, they may be replaced with thermionic emission type cathodes.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      In the above-described image display device, the electrons are emitted from the desired cathodes 31 when a predetermined negative voltage is applied to the cathode electrode 32 and a predetermined positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode 34.
      <br/>
      The emitted electrons are converged by electrostatic lens effect of the penetrating hole 27a formed in the collector electrode 27, and impinge on a metal back layer (not shown) provided on the phosphor surface 22 and to which a high voltage (e.g., +10kV) is applied.
      <br/>
      As a result, the phosphor dots of the phosphor screen 32 emit light to form an image.
      <br/>
      At this time, a considerable amount of heat is generated due to the electron emission in case of the field emission type or current flowing wiring an resistance in case of thermionic emission type.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      However, in the above-described conventional image display device, since a high vacuum is maintained in the picture tube, there is no heat dissipation such as convection.
      <br/>
      Therefore, considerable heat is accumulated in the cathode board 6 to make it high temperature.
      <br/>
      The thermal expansion of the cathode board 6 makes the problems that a relationship between the electron emission points in the cathode 31 and pixels of the phosphor surface 22 is changed.
      <br/>
      As a result, a positional relationship between the cathodes 41 of the cathode board 36 and the phosphor dots of the phosphor screen 32 is changed, so the electrons emitted from the cathode electrodes 41 cannot impinge on the adequate phosphor dots, making it impossible to form an image of high quality.
      <br/>
      Further, in case of too excessive thermal expansion of the cathode board 6, it may be broken.

    </p>
    <p num="10">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="11">
      FIGS. 1A and 1B are a cross sectional view and a plan view schematically showing an image display device according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
      <br/>
      The cross section shown in FIG. 1A corresponds to the cross section taken along a line S1 --S1 in FIG. 1B.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, the image display device of the first embodiment has a front glass case 1 provided with a phosphor screen 2 on an inner surface thereof, a rear case 3 facing the front glass case 1, and a sealing portion 5 with which the front glass case 1 and the rear case 3 are hermetically sealed so that an airtight chamber 4 is formed between the inner surface of the front glass case 1 and an inner surface of the rear case 3.
      <br/>
      The front glass case 1 includes a face portion 1a on which the phosphor screen 2 is provided and a side wall 1b extending from the face portion 1a toward the rear case 3.
      <br/>
      The rear case 3 includes a rear portion 3a and a side wall 3b extending from the rear portion 3a toward the front glass case 1.
      <br/>
      The sealing portion 5 is formed between the side wall 1b of the front glass case 1 and the side wall 3b of the rear case 3, for example, by frit glass.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      Further, the image display device of the first embodiment has a cathode board 6 facing the phosphor screen 2 within the airtight chamber 4 and a collector electrode 7 provided between the cathode board 6 and the phosphor screen 2.
      <br/>
      The collector electrode 7 has a function of collecting electrons emitted from the cathodes and is supported on the front glass case 1 or the cathode board 6, for instance.
      <br/>
      A cathode portion 8 of the cathode board 6 includes a plurality of cathodes 31 (show in FIG. 5) facing the phosphor screen 2 for emitting electrons and a wiring pattern 9 for applying a voltage to the cathodes 31.
      <br/>
      The cathode 31 is, for instance, conical as shown in FIG. 5, and electron emitting is controlled by the voltages applied to the cathode 31 and the gate electrode 34.
      <br/>
      A plurality of cathodes 31 are arranged in matrix form and correspond to the phosphor dots composing the phosphor screen 2.
      <br/>
      The phosphor dots of each color R, G or B are arranged in matrix of 480 rows and 640 columns, for instance.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The image display device of the first embodiment also has black treatment films 11 and 12 disposed on a surface of the cathode board 6 on a side of the rear case 3 and an inner surface of the rear case 3.
      <br/>
      The black treatment films 11 and 12 are formed before the assembly of the front glass case 1, the cathode board 6 and the rear case 3.
      <br/>
      One method to form the black treatment films 11 and 12 at low cost are spray method using graphite liquid.
      <br/>
      Alternately, the black treatment films 11 and 12 may be formed by deposition of aluminum.
      <br/>
      The deposition avoid the decontamination in the chamber 4.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In the above-described image display device of the first embodiment, electrons are emitted from the cathode 31 when a given negative voltage is applied to the cathode 31 and a given positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode 34.
      <br/>
      The emitted electrons are collected by electrostatic effect of the penetrating holes 7a of the collector electrode 7, and accelerated by high voltage (for instance, 10kV) applied to the metalback layer 2a provided on an inner surface of the phosphor screen 2 on the side of the cathode board 6.
      <br/>
      The accelerated electrons with high energy strikes the phosphor dots of the phosphor screen 2, causing the phosphor dots to emit light so that an image is displayed on the phosphor screen 2.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      As described above, in the image display device of the first embodiment, the heat generated in the cathode board 6 is effectively emitted to the outside of the chamber 4 by radiation from the black treatment films 11 and 12.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is possible to reduce color shift and color inconsistency resulted from thermal expansion of the cathode board 6, thereby making it possible to form an image of high quality.
      <br/>
      Further, the image display device of the first embodiment can prevent the cathode board 6 and the sealing portion 5 from being broken due to the thermal expansion of the cathode board 6.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Furthermore, the cathode board 6 is not supported on the rear portion 3a of the rear case 3 and is held on the sealing portion 5 between the side wall 1b of the front glass case 1 and the side wall 3b of the rear case 3, a deformation or inward warp of the rear portion 3a of the rear case 3 occurring after ejection of gas from the airtight chamber 4 does not cause a deformation or warp of the cathode board 6.
      <br/>
      As a result, a positional relationship between the cathodes 41 of the cathode board 6 and the phosphor dots of the phosphor screen 2 is not changed, so the electrons emitted from the cathodes 41 impinge on the adequate phosphor dots, making it possible to form an image of high quality.
    </p>
