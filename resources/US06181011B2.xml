      An integrated circuit (IC chip) has features such as conductive lines.
      <br/>
      The features have a thickness "T", a width "W", and a distance (spacing) "S" between adjacent features, and one or more of the following aspect ratio relationships: a ratio of width:thickness (W/T) is less than or equal to 0.7:1; a ratio of width:spacing (W:S) is less than or equal to 0.7:1; and a ratio of thickness:spacing (T:S) is less than or equal to 0.1:1.

      These relationships are particularly applicable to ICs having a feature geometry (width) of less than 0.16 microns and operating at less than 1.8 volts.

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to dimensions and ratios of dimensions of features of elements of integrated circuit (IC) chips, primarily metal lines, but also including poly-silicon or other device features.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Modern integrated circuit (IC) chips comprise a semiconductor substrate and a large number of active devices (e.g., transistors, gates) which are formed in the substrate and which are interconnected to one another with conductive traces (lines).
      <br/>
      The traces typically are formed either of metal or of polysilicon, and resemble a ribbon having a width dimension (W) and a thickness dimension (T).
      <br/>
      A large number of such conductive traces are typically present on a given IC chip, and are spaced a distance (S) from one another.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      As a general proposition, the trend is towards forming features, including conductive traces (e.g., metal lines), which are smaller and smaller, permitting an increasing number of active devices to be interconnected in increasingly complex manners on semiconductor devices, thereby enabling enhanced functionality and increased operating speeds.
      <br/>
      In other words, reducing device dimensions allows higher density logic integration and faster speeds.
      <br/>
      This has been the primary motivation of plunging into sub-micron dimensions.
      <br/>
      The scaling trend towards smaller-and-smaller dimensions leads to smaller feature size, complex device physics, increase of chip size, increase in operating frequencies and increase in chip complexity.
      <br/>
      The physical parameters affected are decrease of gate and metal width, spacing and thickness, decrease of dielectric thickness and increase of interconnect length.
      <br/>
      The scaling impact on the electrical parameters is potentially an increase of total capacitance, with increasingly dominant coupling effects, increase of interconnect resistance and the inductance effects at chip level.
      <br/>
      Interconnect effects, mainly delay, starts playing the dominant role in deciding the performance of the circuit at small geometries, such as 0.35  MU m and below.
      <br/>
      By plotting wire-length distribution over feature size and die size, it is evident that signal delay is dominated by RC interconnect peaks as we go to lower feature size and higher die size.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Scaling is not done by the same factors for all the variables i.e. length, width, thickness of gate and metal layers, dielectric thickness and voltage are not scaled by the same factors.
      <br/>
      It can be shown that in some cases it is not allowed by available technology, for example, some dimensions are not practicable by current lithography, diffusion, etc. limitations and other cases it will not lead to high performance ICs.
    </p>
    <p num="5">The technology solutions available to solve this problem are:</p>
    <p num="6">
      1) Increase in the number of layers, which will result in shorter interconnects;
      <br/>
      2) Using higher conductivity materials like copper, since resistance is inversely proportional to conductivity; and
      <br/>
      3) Using materials with low dielectric constant like polyimide.
    </p>
    <p num="7">All the above solutions leads to higher cost for production (fab) and design.</p>
    <p num="8">
      Utilizing what is now considered to be "old" technologies, feature sizes limited to on the order of &gt;0.5  MU m resulted, and resemble a wide ribbon having a width dimension (W) which is substantially in excess of the thickness dimension (T) along the length of trace for older technologies.
      <br/>
      In other words, typically W&gt;&gt;T, or the cross-sectional area ratio W:T is &gt;&gt;1.
    </p>
    <p num="9">Newer technologies, facilitating smaller geometries (on the order of 0.35  MU m feature size), permit near one-to-one (1:1) ratio of width-to-thickness, or tall thin cross-sectional structures over the length of a conductive trace.</p>
    <heading>DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="10">
      Integrated circuit (IC) chips, such as those found in computers and electronic equipment, often contain up to millions of transistors and other circuit elements fabricated on a single chip.
      <br/>
      To achieve a desired functionality, a complex network of signal paths must typically be routed to interconnect the circuit elements with one another.
      <br/>
      Efficient routing of signals across a chip becomes increasingly difficult as integrated circuit complexity grows.
      <br/>
      To ease this task, interconnection wiring, which not too many years ago was limited to a single level of metal conductors (traces, lines), on today's devices may contain a plurality (e.g., five or more) stacked levels of interconnection wiring of densely-packed conductive (typically metallic) traces separated by layers of insulating (dielectric) material.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      Modern interconnect (wiring) layers typically are formed by one of two general techniques.
      <br/>
      In a first technique ("deposit-pattern-etch"), a conductive film (layer) is "blanket" deposited over a preferably planar underlying insulation layer which usually contains vias, or through holes, allowing the conductive film to contact underlying circuit structures where electrical connections to those circuit structures are required.
      <br/>
      Portions of the conductive film are then selectively etched away, in any of a number of known ways typically using a mask pattern (and an etchant), leaving a network (pattern) of separate conductors, each having a similar thickness, and each having a generally rectangular cross-section extending across the underlying insulating layer.
      <br/>
      Prior to forming a subsequent wiring layer, the conductors are covered with an interlevel dielectric layer and the processes of depositing and patterning another conductive film are repeated, as required.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A second technique for forming interconnection layers is known as the "damascene" process, so-named as being reminiscent of an inlaid metal technique perfected in ancient Damascus for decorating swords and the like.
      <br/>
      The damascene technique involves etching a network (pattern) of channels (trenches) into the top surface of an insulating (dielectric) layer which preferably has been planarized, such as by chemical-mechanical polishing, and then depositing a conductive film over the etched insulating layer, thereby filling the channels with conductive material.
      <br/>
      Then, excess conductive material which is not in the channels, but rather is on the top surface of the insulating layer, is removed, such as by chemical-mechanical etching, which also helps planarize the insulating layer in preparation for applying, etching channels in and filling with conductive material a subsequent insulating layer.
      <br/>
      This process was described in the patent literature as early as 1990, and reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,944,836, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The damascene process is particularly attractive for sub-micron interconnect fabrication.
      <br/>
      Chemical etching processes are well known which can anisotropically (i.e., unidirectionally) etch insulating material such as silicon dioxide to form high-aspect ratio (i.e., deep and narrow) channels (trenches) with vertical sidewalls.
      <br/>
      Materials such as low resistivity, high copper content conductive materials which are not readily patterned by masking and etching can be employed.
      <br/>
      And the damascene, by virtue of the polishing step between the application of each layer of conductive lines, results in highly planarized interconnection layers, a feature which is desirable for making multilevel (multi-layer) interconnections.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      As a general proposition, the harder the conductive material, the better the damascene process works.
      <br/>
      It has been noted that when working with soft materials such as Al--Cu alloys, the polishing step can result in scratching, smearing, corrosion and dishing of the conductive material, removing conductive material in the channels to below the level of the top surface of the insulating layer.
      <br/>
      This problem was addressed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,354, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein, which proposed depositing the soft metal such that the channels are underfilled (filled to between a few hundred nanometers (nm) and a few hundred Angstroms ( Angstrom ) of the top surface of the insulating layer), then "capping" the soft material with a harder material such as tungsten before polishing.
      <br/>
      This approach, however, requires exacting control for an anisotropic deposition of the soft metal to the required depth tolerance, particularly given normal variations in trench depth and metal deposition rate across the surface of the insulating layer (typically, across the surface of an entire semiconductor wafer being processed).
      <br/>
      The typically higher resistance of the harder capping layer also tends to result in an undesirable increase in resistance for the conductors fabricated on a given interconnect level, unless compensations in conductor height and/or width are incorporated into the design.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      An issue of general concern when forming conductive lines, whether by the masking/etching technique or by the damascene process is that a typical interconnection layer often contains conductors having different widths.
      <br/>
      Conductors which will carry a small current during operation will typically be narrower than conductors carrying larger currents.
      <br/>
      This can result in uneven etching when using the masking/etching technique, and a propensity for the wider conductors to dish when using the damascene process.
    </p>
    <p num="16">U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,423 (1997), incorporated in its entirety by reference herein, discloses a damascene process wherein pillars are formed in wide trenches to avoid overetching or dishing in the large channels by acting as an etch stop for polishing of the conductive material deposited into and over the wide trench.</p>
    <p num="17">
      Although the damascene process offers the advantage of improved planarization, it is time consuming in requiring numerous processing steps.
      <br/>
      Undesirably, an interface exists between the conductive via and conductive wiring.
      <br/>
      Moreover, adequate planarized layers containing an interwiring spacing less than 0.35  MU m cannot be obtained.
      <br/>
      In response to this, the dual damascene process was developed.
      <br/>
      The dual damascene process involves the simultaneous formation of a conductive via and conductive wiring, thereby requiring fewer manipulative steps than the single damascene process and eliminating the interface between the conductive via and the conductive wiring.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,423 (1997), incorporated in its entirety by reference herein, discloses a dual damascene process wherein an opening or a via is initially formed in a second insulating layer above a first insulating layer with an etch stop layer therebetween.
      <br/>
      A larger opening for a trench is then formed in the second insulting layer while simultaneously extending the via opening through the etch stop layer and first insulating layer.
      <br/>
      The trench and via are then simultaneously filled with conductive material.
    </p>
    <p num="19">Additional improvements and modifications to the damascene process for forming conductive lines are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,568 (1997), U.S. Pat. No. 5,708,303 (1998), U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,457 (1998), U.S. Pat. No. 5,753,967 (1998), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,904 (1998), all of which are incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.</p>

      The present invention addresses itself to a number of "aspect ratios" relating to features such as conductive traces on integrated circuit (IC) chips, including the aforementioned width-to-thickness, or cross-sectional area (W:T) ratio.
      <br/>
      Another critical dimension of feature size in integrated circuits which is addressed by the present invention relates to the ratio (W:S) of the width of a conductive trace in comparison to the separation (S) of the conductive trace from the next nearest conductive trace.

    <p num="95">
      Several advantages result as a consequence of the present invention being able to shrink feature size on an integrated circuit (IC) chip.
      <br/>
      A distinct advantage is that by facilitating the manufacture of IC chips (semiconductor devices) having smaller features, a given semiconductor device can be made smaller, hence facilitating increased speed and performance.
      <br/>
      Additionally, the smaller the semiconductor device is, the more copies of the semiconductor device can be fabricated on a given semiconductor wafer.
      <br/>
      Such higher densities translate into lower material cost per device.
      <br/>
      Also, since discrete physical defects may randomly exist on a given wafer--rendering semiconductor devices physically incorporating such defects inoperable--by being able to fit more, smaller semiconductor devices on a given wafer, the probability of a physical defect occurring in a given semiconductor device is reduced, thus resulting in higher yields and lower per unit cost.

      FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional integrated circuit (IC) chip 100 comprising a semiconductor (typically single crystal silicon) substrate 102 having a plurality of circuit elements (not shown, well known) formed therein and extending to the top (as viewed) surface thereof.
      <br/>
      Also illustrated in this figure are a plurality (two of many shown) of features which are conductive lines 112 and 114 disposed atop an insulating layer 108 which have been formed by the deposit-pattern-etch process described hereinabove.

      FIG. 2 illustrates another conventional integrated circuit (IC) chip 200 (compare 100) comprising a semiconductor (typically single crystal silicon) substrate 202 (compare 102) having a plurality of circuit elements (not shown, well known) formed therein and extending to the top (as viewed) surface thereof.
      <br/>
      Also illustrated in this figure are a plurality (two of many shown) of features which are conductive lines 212 and 214 (compare 112 and 114) embedded in an insulating layer 206 which is atop another insulating layer 208 (compare 108), which have been formed by the damascene process described hereinabove.
      <br/>
      The conductive lines 212 and 214 are metallic, as indicated by the single-line cross-hatching in the figure.

      Also illustrated in the figure is a via through the insulting layer 208 which has been filled with a conductive material 210 (compare 110), typically metal as indicated by the single-line cross-hatching in the figure.

      FIG. 3 illustrates another conventional integrated circuit (IC) chip 300 (compare 100, 200) comprising a semiconductor (typically single crystal silicon) substrate 302 (compare 102, 202) having a plurality of circuit elements (not shown, well known) formed therein and extending to the top (as viewed) surface thereof.
      <br/>
      Also illustrated in this figure are a plurality (two of many shown) of features which are conductive lines 312 and 314 (compare 112/114 and 212/214) embedded in an insulating layer 306 (compare 206) which is atop another insulating layer 308 (compare 108, 208).
      <br/>
      In the case of the conductive lines 312 and 314 having been formed by the deposit-pattern-etch process (compare FIG. 1), this insulating layer 306 is likely deposited as part of an overall interlevel dielectric layer 316 applied over the conductive lines 312 and 314 in preparation for applying another level of metallization to the IC chip 302.
      <br/>
      As in the previously-described figures, the conductive lines 312 and 314 are metallic, and a via extends through the insulting layer 308 which has been filled with a conductive material 310 (compare 110, 210) so that the conductive line 312 is in electrical contact with a circuit element (not shown) formed in the semiconductor substrate 302.

      <br/>
      Vias (not shown) extending through the dielectric layer 316 would be filled with conductive material to effect connections between conductive lines in the metallization layer represented by the conductive line 318 and conductive lines in the metallization layer represented by the conductive lines 312 and 314.

      FIG. 4 is a schematic cross-sectional type illustration of an IC chip 400 (compare 100, 200, 300) comprising a semiconductor substrate 402 (compare 102, 202, 302) having conductive lines 412 and 414 (compare 112/114, 212/214, 312/314) atop an insulating layer 408 (compare 108, 208, 308).
      <br/>
      The insulating layer 408 could as well be the insulating layer 316 described with respect to FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="103">
      FIG. 4 illustrates certain dimensional parameters associated with the conductive lines 412 and 414.
      <br/>
      Herein it can be seen that each conductive line has a thickness "T" and a width "W".
      <br/>
      Also shown is that a one conductive line (e.g., 412) is spaced a distance "S" apart from a neighboring conductive line (e.g., 414). (The dimension "S" is the distance between adjacent features.) Also shown is a thickness dimension "H" of the underlying insulating layer 408.
    </p>
    <p num="104">
      It is a principal object of the present invention to define critical dimensions for these dimensional parameters, in terms of scaling ratios, the aim being to "fine tune" for optimal performance criteria such as speed and power, which leads to minimal interconnect delay with topologies that can be manufactured with current (or soon to be available) process technologies.
      <br/>
      There follows an analysis of capacitance effects present when two conductive lines are in proximity with one another.
      <br/>
      The resistance of conductive lines is a relatively well-known characteristic, dependent primarily on cross-sectional area, length and materials, and is not analyzed herein.
    </p>
    <p num="105">
      In the analysis of capacitance that follows, a contribution of resistance to the delay is not considered, for simplicity's sake.
      <br/>
      An approximate empirical formula for capacitance is:
      <br/>
      C=CINTRINSIC +CCOUPLING,
    </p>
    <p num="106">
      where
      <br/>

      CCOUPLING =Eo*Eox �0.03(W/H)+0.83(T/H) -0.07 (T/H)0.222 �(S/H)-1.3

    <p num="107">Where:</p>
    <p num="108">
      L - length of the interconnect
      <br/>
      W - width of the interconnect
      <br/>
      T - thickness of the interconnect
      <br/>
      H - oxide thickness
      <br/>
      S - spacing between two parallel conductors
    </p>
    <p num="109">The coupling expression doesn't include coupling between layers.</p>
    <p num="110">The capacitance computed using the above expressions may have a maximum 10% error for the lateral capacitance with 0.3&lt;W/H&lt;10, 0.3&lt;T/H&lt;10, and 0.5&lt;S/H&lt;10, and a maximum 6% error for the overlap and fringing capacitance with 0.3&lt;W/H &lt;30 and 0.3&lt;T/H&lt;30.</p>
    <p num="111">
      As the feature size reduces from 0.35 u to 0.07 u, the interconnect shrinks in dimensions.
      <br/>
      The above expressions indicates that capacitance reduces with decrease in width of interconnect.
      <br/>
      The reduction should take into consideration current density, which may lead to electromigration, lower breakdown voltages, punch-through and oxide polarization.
      <br/>
      But current advances in CMOS technology allows us to reduce the operating voltages to lower values, from 5V to 1.8V, which alleviates the problems mentioned earlier and allows us to create interconnect with minimum dimensions.
