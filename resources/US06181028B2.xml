      <br/>
      A transfer mechanism is provided for transferring the supply of power between a generator and utility source.
      <br/>
      The transfer mechanism includes a monitoring system for monitoring the power supplied by the utility source.
      <br/>
      The monitoring system starts the generator in response to a power outage from the utility source and stops the generator in response to the restoration of power from the utility source.
      <br/>
      A power relay has a utility input connectable to the utility source, a generator input connectable to the generator, an output connectable to a load, and a movable contact for selectively interconnecting one of the inputs to the output in response to the generation of power by the generator.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      As is known, virtually all facilities which utilize electric power receive such power from a utility company.
      <br/>
      Typically, such utility companies have an excellent record of providing uninterrupted or infrequently interrupted power at proper voltage levels and line frequency.
      <br/>
      However, due to the increasing demands for power, power outages have become more frequent.
      <br/>
      While such outages usually last for a only a short duration, an extended power outage may cause more than simple aggravation for customers of the utility company.
      <br/>
      By way of example, for a residential customer, any power outage renders a home owner's sump pump inoperable.
      <br/>
      If a power outage occurs during a rain storm, it is quite possible that the failure of the sump pump to operate will result in the flooding of a home owner's basement.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      In order to overcome these occasional disruptions in service, various customers, including home owners, have equipped their facilities with stand-by power systems.
      <br/>
      These stand-by power systems include internal combustion engines which drive electrical generators.
      <br/>
      If the commercial power from the utility company fails, the internal combustion engine is automatically started causing the electrical generator to generate power.
      <br/>
      When the power generated by the generator reaches the voltage and frequency desired by the customer, a manually operated transfer switch transfers the load imposed by the customer from the commercial power lines to the generator.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Typically, the transfer mechanism incorporates a switch which isolates the power supplied by the utility company and the generator.
      <br/>
      In a residential application, a home owner manually flips a switch between the utility source and the generator in order to provide power to the electrical system of the home.
      <br/>
      However, due to a potential time delay before the home owner can flip the switch, a significant amount of damage may be sustained by a home owner before power is supplied to the electrical system of the home.
      <br/>
      For example, an extended power outage may result in foodstuffs spoiling within a refrigerator or melting within a freezer.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is highly desirable to provide a transfer mechanism which automatically transfers power from the utility company to the generator whenever the generator is activated.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Further, prior art transfer mechanisms require a home owner to transfer the entire electrical system of the home onto the generator.
      <br/>
      Such an arrangement does not allow a home owner the ability to decide which circuits of a home's electrical system to be powered.
      <br/>
      As such, it is also desirable to provide a transfer mechanism which allows various branch circuits of a home to be brought on line separately, rather than at once, to allow for loads with large starting requirements to be brought up to speed before bringing the other circuit branches of the home on line thereby insuring that adequate power is provided by the generator to start such loads.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Therefore, it is a primary object and feature of the present invention to provide a transfer mechanism for transferring power between a utility source and a stand-by generator.</p>
    <p num="7">It is a further object and feature of the present invention to provide a transfer mechanism which automatically transfers power from the utility source to the generator in response to a power outage.</p>
    <p num="8">It is a still further object and feature of the present invention to provide a transfer mechanism for transferring power between a utility source and a generator which allows for the bringing of individual circuit branches of a home electrical system on line separately.</p>
    <p num="9">It is a still further object and feature of the present invention to provide a transfer mechanism which is simple to install and inexpensive to manufacture.</p>

      As is conventional, monitoring circuit 188 monitors the power supplied by the utility source 44.
      <br/>
      In response to a power outage from the utility source 42, monitoring circuit 188 starts the internal combustion engine of the generator 44.
      <br/>
      As heretofore described, a starting of the internal combustion motor causes the electrical generator of generator 44 to generate electrical power across lines 104 and 106.

      With circuit breaker 122 toggled to its on-position, current flows through magnetic coil K1 of power relay 92 such that the magnetic coil K1 becomes magnetized and attracts movable contacts 198 and 200 within power relay 92.
      <br/>
      As a result, movable contacts 198 and 200 disengage from normally closed contacts 88 and 90, respectively, and close against corresponding normally open contacts 140 and 142, respectively, so as to operatively connect a corresponding load to generator 44.

    <p num="35">
      In response to the restoration of power from utility source 42, monitoring circuit 188 stops the internal combustion engine of the generator 44.
      <br/>
      By stopping the internal combustion engine, the electrical generator of generator 44 no longer generates power across lines 104 and 106 and current ceases to flow through magnetic coils K1, K2 and K3 of power relays 92, 79 and 77, respectively.
      <br/>
      As a result, movable contacts 190 and 192 of power relay 77 disengage from normally open contacts 124 and 126, respectively, and reclose against corresponding normally closed contacts 70 and 76, respectively, so as to operatively connect corresponding loads to utility source 42.
