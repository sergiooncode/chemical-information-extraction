      <br/>
      A method for driving a linear oscillating motor and a linear oscillating motor are provided.
      <br/>
      The motor includes a fixed magnetic member, a movable member having a magnet and being supported to oscillate relative to the fixed magnetic member, a detector that detects displacement of the movable member, and a control that oscillates the movable member by sending drive current to a coil of the fixed magnetic member.
      <br/>
      The method includes controlling, during a first half-period that occurs within a full amplitude period of the movable member, the drive current based upon the output of the detector.
      <br/>
      The method also includes controlling, during a second half-period that occurs within a fill amplitude period of the movable member, the drive current based upon a fixed drive current waveform.

    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="8">
      The present invention provides a method for driving a linear oscillating motor with high frequency oscillation without requiring the use of a high performance controller.
      <br/>
      The linear oscillating motor includes a fixed magnet (e.g., an electromagnet or a permanent magnet).
      <br/>
      A movable member is supported so as to freely oscillate relative to the fixed magnet, and is provided with an electromagnet or a permanent magnet.
      <br/>
      A detector detects displacement of the movable member relative to the fixed magnet.
      <br/>
      A controller generates a control current to control oscillation of the movable member, in response to the output of the detector.
      <br/>
      The controller provides a variable drive current (based upon the output of the detector) to oscillate the movable member during only one (a first half-period) of the two half-periods (making up the oscillation period of the movable member).
      <br/>
      During the other half-period (a second half-period), the controller oscillates the movable member according to a fixed drive current (waveform) which has a predetermined constant energy.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      Based upon the output of the detector, the controller may optionally not apply the fixed drive current waveform during the other half-period (which may be considered as applying a zero current waveform).
      <br/>
      A variable drive current control region, defined as the region over the portion of the full period over which the controller applies variable drive current, may be expanded into the second half-period.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, when the fixed drive current is not applied, the variable drive current control region may be adjusted based upon output of the detector.
      <br/>
      This can reduce fluctuation in amplitude of drive current within a full oscillation period.
    </p>
    <p num="10">The detector can detect displacement of the movable member during either or both of the half-periods.</p>
    <p num="11">
      According to an embodiment of the invention, a method for driving a linear oscillating motor is provided.
      <br/>
      The motor includes a fixed magnetic member, a movable member having a magnet and being supported to oscillate relative to the fixed magnetic member, a detector that detects displacement of the movable member, and a controller that oscillates the movable member by sending drive current to a coil of the fixed magnetic member.
      <br/>
      The method includes controlling, during a first half-period that occurs within a full amplitude period of the movable member, the drive current based upon the output of the detector.
      <br/>
      The method also includes controlling, during a second half-period that occurs within a full amplitude period of the movable member, the drive current based on a fixed drive current waveform.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A feature of the above embodiment provides for monitoring an output of the detector, and suppressing the fixed drive current waveform during the second half-period, such that no drive current is applied to the coil during the second half-period.

      The motor includes a fixed magnetic member, a movable member having a magnet and being supported to oscillate relative to the fixed magnetic member, a detector that detects displacement of the movable member, and a control that controls oscillation of the movable member.

      The method includes detecting an oscillation parameter of the movable member; triggering variable control of oscillation of the movable member, where the variable control is based upon the oscillation parameter; terminating variable control triggering, fixed control of oscillation of the movable member, where the fixed control is independent of the oscillation parameter; and terminating fixed control.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="23">
      Referring now to FIG. 2, an example of a linear oscillation motor is shown.
      <br/>
      A fixed member 1, which is an electromagnet with a coil 11 in the exemplary embodiment is mounted to a frame 3.
      <br/>
      A movable member 2 supports a first magnet 20 and a second magnet 29 (e.g., a permanent or electromagnets).
      <br/>
      Movable member 2 is mounted to opposing sides of frame 3 by springs 4 such that it can oscillate freely relative to frame 3.
      <br/>
      A magnetic detection coil 39, mounted on frame 3, outputs a voltage responsive to an oscillation parameter (e.g., displacement, amplitude, velocity, acceleration, etc.) of magnet 29 (and thus of movable member 2) relative to frame 3; in the exemplary embodiment, the parameter is displacement.
      <br/>
      A sensor 6 detects the oscillation parameter of movable member 2 from changes in the output of a magnetic detection coil 39.
      <br/>
      Controller 5 receives the output of sensor 6, and responds through a controller output 50 with a control drive current pulse width to coil 11 of fixed member 1.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Referring now to FIG. 1, as movable member 2 oscillates, it generates a generally sinusoidal induced voltage A within magnetic detection coil 39.
      <br/>
      The induced voltage A is zero at the beginning and end of each half-period (i.e., an oscillation amplitude extreme), designated in FIG. 1 as time t. The amplitude of induced voltage A depends upon various parameters of the oscillation, e.g., amplitude, velocity, direction, etc.
      <br/>
      As discussed in more detail below, controller 5 sends a drive current B to coil 11 responsive to the amplitude of induced voltage A.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      As noted above, induced voltage A is zero when movable member 2 is at an oscillation amplitude extreme.
      <br/>
      At a time t0 after time t, the oscillation of movable member 2 generates a voltage V0 (this can be regarded as equivalent to an oscillation amplitude value).
      <br/>
      Controller 5 responds with variable drive current B pulse width control to coil 11 between times t1 -t2, where time t1 is a slightly delayed from time t0.
      <br/>
      During this time, controller 5 continues to monitor the output of coil 39 and adjust variable current drive B accordingly.
      <br/>
      If V0 is large, then the oscillation amplitude is also large, and the corresponding interval between t2 and t1 is shorter.
      <br/>
      If V0 is small, then the oscillation amplitude is also small, and the corresponding interval between t2 and t1 is longer.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      As noted above, control in response to the detected oscillation parameter occurs during the noted half-period within a fill oscillation amplitude period.
      <br/>
      For the other half-period, a fixed drive current waveform B' is supplied to coil 11 from a time t3 to time t4, where time t3 and time t4 are fixed based upon the time t at which the oscillation crosses zero.
      <br/>
      Controller 5 can perform other control operations during this half-period, in addition to providing fixed drive current waveform B' to drive coil 11.
      <br/>
      The fixed drive current waveform is independent from the output of detector 6 during this half-period.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      In the above embodiment, the variable drive current triggers and terminates in response to the output of coil 39 crossing the V0 and -V0 thresholds as noted.
      <br/>
      However, the invention is not so limited.
      <br/>
      Drive control can be carried out during a subsequent half-period based upon the voltage value V0 detected during a current half-period.
      <br/>
      In response to the output of coil 39, the application of drive current is shifted by a period, such that control can be carried out even when the operation is slow.
      <br/>
      Such control is shown in FIG. 4, in which times t5 and t6 in the third half-period are based on the voltage value V0 in the second half-period.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      When applying a fixed drive current waveform within an amplitude oscillation half-period, the variable drive current control region is much shorter in comparison to an entire amplitude oscillation period, such that the amplitude oscillation control region decreases.
      <br/>
      In an alternative embodiment, in response to a certain voltage value V0, controller 5 may optionally not apply (i.e., cut) the fixed current waveform (in essence suppressing the waveform, or applying a zero current waveform).
      <br/>
      This typically occurs when V0 is so high that t1 -t2 =0, such that no drive current is applied at all over the period.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      In another alternative, when controller 5 does not apply the fixed current waveform, it can extend the region over which it applies variable drive current, such as in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The variable drive current region should not, however, expand to include the full oscillation period.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      When the fixed drive current is cut, the drive current sum time (t2 -t1)+(t4 -t3) may greatly decrease.
      <br/>
      This allows for the cut portion of the fixed drive current to adjust the t2 time period to t2 ', where (t2 '-t2)&lt;(t4 -t3) so that the (t2 '-t1) time period is longer based upon voltage value V0.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      As described above, movable member 2 oscillates responsive to drive current sent to coil 11 of fixed member 1, and the drive current is responsive to the output of sensor 6.
      <br/>
      A variable drive current drives the coil during a half-period within a full oscillation amplitude period, and a predetermined current waveform drives the coil during the other half-period.
      <br/>
      Simultaneous performance (or high speed performance) controls are therefore unnecessary, which can eliminate the expense for the same.
      <br/>
      In the alternative or in addition, other operations become possible during the output time interval.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      If the fixed drive current waveform (during the other half-period) is cut, controller 5 can expand the drive current control region during a full amplitude oscillation, as in FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      When adjustment of the drive current control is carried out based upon output of the detector, drive current fluctuation within a full amplitude oscillation period can be lessened, and driving can be carried out more smoothly.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Detection of movable member displacement may be carried out during either half-period.
      <br/>
      High speed control operation becomes unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Referring now to FIG. 5, another embodiment of the invention in which permanent magnet 20 is mounted on frame 3, and an electromagnet with coil 11 is mounted on movable member 2.
      <br/>
      The operation and performance of this embodiment is the same as that described above for the embodiment shown in FIG. 2.
