      Natural gas fields and natural gas storages are encountered in natural subterranean rock cavities.
      <br/>
      Natural gas storages are also encountered in artificial cavities.
      <br/>
      These subterranean rocks are by origin either sedimentary rocks or evaporites.
      <br/>
      These rocks are never dry, and are usually in communication with stratum waters, in many cases with extensive aquifers.
      <br/>
      Water, in particular in the form of salt solutions, therefore is often encountered on sinking a well, during the cementing of the casing, and in the production phase of gas fields.
      <br/>
      Drying out water-containing zones and blocking water influx in production wells is necessary for economic reasons, in order to maintain continuous gas flow and to avoid or decrease the disposal of the transported water, which is associated with high costs.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      A special case occurs in gas fields or gas storages in which the stratum pressure has already fallen markedly below the hydrostatic pressure.
      <br/>
      Stratum water can only penetrate into a well if the water saturation in the vicinity of the well is high enough in order to ensure continuous flow, and the water phase has sufficient expansion energy and/or is entrained by the gas.
      <br/>
      Owing to the higher water saturation in the pore region, the pressure drops increase on flow of the gas phase, and the flow pressure on the well hole bottom decreases, as a result of which the water column in the well hole can increase.
      <br/>
      If the well hole flow pressure is no longer sufficient, a phase of discontinuous gas production with decreased flow rates occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      The reduction of the influx of water into production wells can be effected by two methods: selected blocking, and plugging.
      <br/>
      Of the various process variants for sealing off water influxes into wells and in the cementing operation, plugging methods generally are used.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      For example, the Derwent Abstract of SU 1315602 describes the use of a mixture of tetrabutoxytitanium having a relatively low content of tetrabutoxysilane or tetraethoxysilane for plugging wells against water ingress.
      <br/>
      The Derwent Abstract of SU 1838587 describes the use of ethylsilicates for sealing off oil and gas wells from percolating water.
      <br/>
      In both cases, the gas permeability is also greatly reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="6">Other substances used for plugging are cements, swellable clays, epoxide resins having additives of fiber, and especially useful in the case of fissured rocks, gels, suspensions containing additives and finely divided silicon dioxide.</p>
    <p num="7">
      For plugging water influxes, these must be delimitable, so that the remaining productive zones of the rock do not also suffer.
      <br/>
      A plugging action can be exerted by gels of polymeric solutions of polyacrylamide, copolymers and biopolymers, and silica gels are also mentioned in some applications.
      <br/>
      The gellation of the polymer solution is effected by admixing or after flooding crosslinking substances.
      <br/>
      Another possible method of exerting plugging actions is by precipitation of inorganic salts or organic polymers from aqueous or non-aqueous solvents.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      For selective blocking of the water influxes over the entire thickness of the hydrocarbon-bearing strata, no precautions need to be taken for selecting the points of water ingress.
      <br/>
      The selective blocking is performed by two process variants, that is by adsorption of hydrophilic polymers or by rendering rock surfaces hydrophobic.
    </p>
    <p num="9">
      The hydrophilic adsorption layers increase the flow resistance for the flowing water, which is frequently increased by swelling of the adsorption layer.
      <br/>
      For the hydrocarbon phase, in contrast, there is no significant decrease in the permeability.
      <br/>
      When the rock surface is rendered hydrophobic, the surface tension has a partial blocking action for the penetrating water in the form of the capillary counterpressure.
    </p>
    <p num="10">
      For selective blocking, use is generally made of high molecular weight polymers based on polyacrylamide (also in cationic form), copolymers, terpolymers and biopolymers.
      <br/>
      For rendering the rock surfaces hydrophobic, inter alia, silanes have also been tested.
    </p>
    <p num="11">
      The flow resistance of the blocked rock formation must be sufficient to impede the water at the entry to the production well.
      <br/>
      However, the flow resistance cannot be increased as desired, since the liquids injected for the blocking must be distributed in the rock to develop their blocking action and the gas must thereafter flush clear its flow paths by displacing the excess non-adsorbed treatment liquid.
      <br/>
      In particular, in the case of low rock permeability, the flow resistance must not be excessive, because otherwise the treatment liquid is not injectable and the gas is not able to penetrate the treatment ring.
      <br/>
      Thus plugging instead of blocking takes place.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      A further special case is represented by the gas fields in which the water is very salty.
      <br/>
      There, evaporation of water in the vicinity of the well hole causes the solubility limit to be exceeded; in particular chloride salts crystallize out.
      <br/>
      Since salt water is continuously drawn into the pore cavities by capillary forces, the salt crystals continue to grow until the flow channels are closed to the point of impermeability to natural gas.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The current process for improving the productivity of natural gas wells is the hydraulic generation and stabilization of fractures in the surrounds of the well hole.
      <br/>
      The additional drainage areas produced by this means and the high gas flow density in the fractures leads to an increased well production rate.
      <br/>
      However, this process is very expensive.
      <br/>
      The fracture formation can be controlled only to a very limited extent.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      Salt deposits, in particular chloride salts, can be removed by flushing with fresh water.
      <br/>
      Since the salt deposits continuously reform, these flushings must be carried out regularly, which causes frequent production outages.
    </p>
    <p num="15">It would be desirable to provide a means which permanently improves gas flow in water-containing natural gas wells and natural gas storage wells.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="16">The invention relates to a process for treating water-containing natural gas wells and natural gas storage wells in which a homogeneous phase comprising a water-repellent, solvolysis-resistant active compound is injected into the water-bearing rock.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="17">
      Preferably, the homogeneous phase is injected into the water-bearing rock by means of a well.
      <br/>
      In this case, the active compound is adsorbed or reacts on the rock surface.
      <br/>
      Excess homogeneous phase is preferably distributed in the surrounds of the well by recompressing gas.
      <br/>
      The gas used can be, for this purpose, for example, air, nitrogen or, preferably, natural gas.
    </p>
    <p num="18">The homogeneous phase can be readily distributed in the rock of the natural gas-containing fields and has chemical inertness to the natural gas and the transport devices.</p>
    <p num="19">
      Owing to the selective adsorption of water-repellent active compound, the flow resistance in the rock greatly increases for water, and that for gas falls.
      <br/>
      The water influx is therefore reduced and natural gas can flow better.
      <br/>
      Natural gas is virtually insoluble in the active compound and can, if no excess homogeneous phase obstructs the flow paths, flow through virtually unhindered to the production well.
      <br/>
      The surface-smoothing action of the adsorption layer decreases the friction pressures for injected and transported gas.
      <br/>
      This causes an increased production rate for natural gas at the well hole.
    </p>
    <p num="20">In addition, in rock zones rendered hydrophobic, into which no water flows, the capillary flow of water is greatly decreased and the treated area gradually dries out by evaporation of the water.</p>
    <p num="21">The drying out of the rock in the surrounds of the well avoids the plugging of the capillaries of the rock and salt deposits on equipment for transport, storage and further processing.</p>
    <p num="22">
      Since, at the same capillary pressure, the water saturation in rock of low permeability having narrow capillaries is greater than in more highly permeable rock, the process is particularly suitable for fields having low permeability, where heterogeneous systems can no longer be injected and plugging of the pores in the natural gas field can occur.
      <br/>
      The process can be carried out at rock permeabilities of preferably at least 0.0001  MU m2.
      <br/>
      In addition, use of the method with heterogeneous field rock having varying permeability leads to homogenization of the flow profile in the vicinity of the well hole.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      Since the water-repellent active compound is solvolysis-resistant, the homogeneous phase can be handled considerably more readily than homogeneous phases having solvolyzing active compounds, and it is always ensured that the active compound is employed in the form injected.
      <br/>
      There is thus no risk that the homogeneous phase, due to solvolysis prior to reaching the point of action, becomes a heterogeneous phase which can then cause precipitations or plugging in the well hole or in the rock in the vicinity of the well hole.
      <br/>
      At the point of action itself, the homogeneous phase may become a heterogeneous phase.
      <br/>
      For example, use may be made of aqueous methylsiliconate solutions which, with CO2, form water-repellent and non-water-soluble active compounds.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The water-repellent active compound has the property of not penetrating into water at the point of action, and not remaining therein.
      <br/>
      The water- repellent active compound is, at the point of action, soluble in water at 20 (degree)  C. preferably to an extent of at most 1% by weight, in particular, at most 0.1% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="25">In the process according to the invention, as water-repellent substances, use can be made of, for example, unfluorinated or fluorinated waxes, paraffins, salts of carboxylic acids, organic or organosilicon monomers or polymeric compounds.</p>
    <p num="26">Suitable waxes are, for example, natural waxes such as vegetable waxes, e.g. candellila and carnauba wax; animal waxes, e.g. beeswax and lanolin; mineral waxes, e.g. ceresin and ozokerite; chemically modified natural, and in particular fluorinated, waxes and synthetic waxes, e.g. polyethylene waxes and silicone waxes.</p>
    <p num="27">
      Suitable salts of carboxylic acids are, in particular, the salts of monobasic or polybasic carboxylic acids having from 8 to 50 carbon atoms per carboxyl group.
      <br/>
      Preference is given to the salts of fluorinated carboxylic acids, in particular when these have a perfluoroalkyl radical having at least 4 carbon atoms.
      <br/>
      Examples of preferred salts of monobasic fluorinated carboxylic acids are the alkali metal salts of arylcarboxylic acids, such as benzoic acids or naphthoic acids bearing one or two perfluoroalkyl radicals having preferably 4 to 18 carbon atoms.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      As fluorinated organic polymeric compounds, use can be made in the process according to the invention, for example, of all those compounds which have also previously been able to be used or have been used for rendering organic substances, such as organic fibers, and inorganic substances water-repellent.
      <br/>
      Examples of such compounds are polymers prepared from at least partially fluorinated monomers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene, poly(vinyl fluoride), poly(vinylidene fluoride), polytrifluorochloroethylene, copolymers of trifluorochloroethylene and other monomers, such as vinylidene fluoride, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, methyl methacrylate or styrene; and fluorinated acrylic resins, such as homopolymers and copolymers of perfluoroalkyl-containing acrylic and methacrylic esters with acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and their derivatives.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Preferred examples of fluorinated acrylic resins are poly(1,1-dihydroperfluorobutyl acrylate) and mixed polymers of n-butyl acrylate, N-methylolacrylamide and at least 35% by weight of 1,1,2,2-tetrahydroperfluoro-C1 to C16 -alkyl methacrylate having a linear alkyl chain.</p>
    <p num="30">Further examples of such fluorinated acrylic resins are the alkali metal salts of copolymers of the abovementioned acrylates, methacrylates, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid which preferably have a fluorine content of at least 20% by weight.</p>
    <p num="31">
      Further examples of fluorinated organic polymeric compounds are synthetic organic polymers fluorinated after polymerization, such as poly(vinyl chloride), polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl alcohol), polycarbonate, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, poly(vinylidene chloride), poly(vinyl fluoride), poly(vinylidene fluoride), poly(vinylidene cyanide), polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polyether, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, polyimide, silicones, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol) and their derivatives, which are fluorinated in the side chains or in the main chains.
      <br/>
      The polymers fluorinated after polymerization preferably have a fluorine content of at least 10% by weight.
      <br/>
      Particular preference is given to polyurethane resins having a fluorine content of 25-35% by weight.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      In particular, preference is given as water-repellent active compound to organosilicon compounds, since these are heat-stable at temperatures prevailing in fields of 130 (degree)  C. and considerably higher.
      <br/>
      The action rendering rock surface hydrophobic persists for a long period.

      Examples 1 to 5 below, directed to reducing the capillary forces and, in association therewith for preventing salt precipitation and improving the gas flow in the capillaries, were carried out on sample cores of dry sandstone having a gas permeability of 0.45 to 0.50  MU m2 from Fontainebleau, France.
      <br/>
      The cylindrical sample cores had a length of 4 cm and a diameter of 3 cm.

    <p num="73">EXAMPLES 1 to 5</p>
    <p num="74">The following experimental protocol was followed using the sample cores:</p>
    <p num="75">
      a) The sample cores were dried overnight at 90 (degree)  C.
      <br/>
      b) The dried sample cores were placed in a vacuum-tight vessel and the vessel was evacuated.
      <br/>
      When vacuum was reached, the vessel was separated from the vacuum pump by closing a stopcock and dem. water was drawn into the vessel via a second connection.
      <br/>
      After the sample cores were completely immersed in dem. water, the vessel was vented.
      <br/>
      The sample cores were weighed to determine mv.
      <br/>
      c) The sample cores were dried overnight at 90 (degree)  C. and then weighed to determine m1.
      <br/>
      d) The dried sample cores were each rolled in an absorbent filter paper strip of width 7 cm and length 19.2 cm in such a manner that the core was wrapped twice and the paper projected approximately 4 cm at one side.
      <br/>
      The filter paper was pressed onto the cylindrical surface by an elastic latex tube.
      <br/>
      In a water-vapor-saturated environment, the projecting paper was placed in dem. water, so that the end of the paper dipped into the water, but the core was situated above the water surface.
      <br/>
      After seven hours the core was unwrapped and weighed to determine mF1.
      <br/>
      e) The reference value for dem. water of the spontaneous imbibition Sw(sp)ref was calculated using the equation  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      The spontaneous imbibition describes the displacement of the non-wetting phase by the wetting phase.
      <br/>
      f) The sample cores were dried overnight at 90 (degree)  C.
      <br/>
      g) Similarly to measure b), the sample cores were soaked with organopolysiloxane solution which comprised organopolysiloxanes as hydrophobic-rendering active compound in 5% strength concentration.
      <br/>
      To remove any excess, the cores were blown free with nitrogen.
      <br/>
      h) The sample cores were dried for 17 h at 90 (degree)  C. and weighed to determine m2.
      <br/>
      i) Similarly to measure d), the dry sample cores were wrapped in filter paper strips and placed in dem. water.
      <br/>
      After seven hours, the core was unwrapped and weighed to determine mF2.

      j) The spontaneous imbibition Sw(sp)1 after treating the cores with homogeneous solution was calculated using the equation  (Equation image '3' not included in text)
      <br/>
      k) The sample cores were again dried at 90 (degree)  C. Measures i) and j) were carried out again.
