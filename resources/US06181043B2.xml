    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="12">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="13">A stator of a vehicle alternator according to a first embodiment of the invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1-6.</p>
    <p num="14">In FIG. 1, vehicle alternator 1 is composed of stator 2, rotor 3, a pair of frames 4, rectifier 5 and others.</p>
    <p num="15">
      Stator 2 is composed of stator core 32, a plurality of conductor segments 33 forming a stator winding and insulator 34 disposed between stator core 32 and the conductor segments 33.
      <br/>
      Stator core 32 is a laminate of cylindrical thin steel sheets which has a plurality of slots in the inner periphery thereof.
      <br/>
      Conductor segments 33 extend from stator core 32 to form coil ends 31.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      Rotor 3 is composed of cylindrical field coil 8, a pair of pole cores 7 respectively having six claw poles which enclose field coil therebetween and shaft 6 press-fitted to the pair of cores 7.
      <br/>
      Rotor 3 has a mixed flow type cooling fan 11 at the front end thereof to supply cooling air from front portions of the rotor in the axial and radial directions and a centrifugal type cooling fan 12 at the rear end thereof to supply cooling air from rear portions of the rotor in the radial direction.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      The pair of frames 4 accommodates and supports stator 2 and rotor 3 so that rotor 3 can rotate about shaft 6 and stator core 2 can be disposed around circumference of rotor 3 at a certain air gap.
      <br/>
      The pair of frames 4 has air-discharge windows 42 at the portions thereof opposite to coil ends 31 of stator 2 and air-intake windows 41 at the axially opposite surfaces thereof.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Vehicle alternator 1 is driven to rotate by an engine (not shown) via pulley 20 and a belt.
      <br/>
      When field coil 8 is supplied with exciting current, the claw poles of the pair of pole cores 7 are excited to generate three-phase ac voltage in the stator winding, and dc power is supplied from output terminals of rectifier 5.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      As shown in FIG. 2, each of the U-shaped copper conductor segments 33 has U-turn portion 33c, inner-portion 33a to be disposed in one of slots 35 at a circumference inside U-turn portion 33c and outer-portion 33b to be disposed in another of slots 35 at a circumference outside U-turn portion 33c.
      <br/>
      Each of inner-portion 33a and outer-portion 33b has a straight portion to be disposed in one of slots 35 and a portion to extend outward from the one of slots 35.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      When the stator winding is formed, two conductor segments 33 are inserted in every one of slots 35 and each end portion 33d is connected with a different end portion 33d extending from a different one of slots 35.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 3, both inner-portion 33a and outer-portion 33b have a rectangular cross-section with the radial sides being longer than the circumferential sides.
      <br/>
      Because conductor segments 33 are not coated with insulating material, a S-shaped insulator 34 is disposed in each of slots 35 to insulate two conductor segments from each other.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      As shown in FIG. 4, U-turn portions 33c are disposed at the same end of stator core 32.
      <br/>
      Inclined portions 33e extending left are formed from outer-portion 33b , and inclined portions 33e extending right are formed from inner-portion 33a to form uniform coil ends 31.
      <br/>
      Each of connected portions 33f is formed to join another as shown in FIG. 5A.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Joining end portions 33d are welded together by a contactless type welder such as a tungsten inert-gas welder (hereinafter referred to as the TIG welder) so that only limited area of end portions can be melted to form ball-shaped or raindrop-shaped connected portions 33f.
      <br/>
      The TIG welder discharges arc current between a tungsten electrode and a base metal member in an inert gas to melt the base metal member and a filler metal member for welding.
      <br/>
      The TIG welder can control quantity of heat and quantity of filler material separately.
    </p>
    <p num="23">End portions 33d of neighboring conductor segments 33 are put side by side, and a nozzle having a tungsten electrode is brought near the end portions 33d to be welded by the TIG welder.</p>
    <p num="24">
      Because conductor segments 33 made of copper are highly heat conductive, each of connected portions 33f is melted wide enough to form a raindrop-shaped ball without any edge due to surface tension as shown in FIG. 5B. Each of connected portions 33f becomes larger than conductor segment 33 both in thickness (T&gt;t) and in width (W&gt;2w).
      <br/>
      Thus, sufficient mechanical strength and electrical connection can be provided at the connected portions 33f.
      <br/>
      The edge-less ball-shaped portions are free from concentration of stresses and corrosion.
      <br/>
      The ball-shaped surface of the connected portion 33f is coated evenly with resinous film 33g for protection and insulation as shown in FIG. 5C.
    </p>
    <p num="25">The stator winding is formed as follows. U-shaped conductor segments 33 are inserted into respective slots 35 of stator 2 so that U-turn portions 33c are disposed on the same axial end of stator core 32, so that outer-portions 33b are disposed at the inner portion of slots 35 (or an outer circumference of stator core 32), and inner-portion 33a are disposed in the outlet portion of slots 35 (or an inner circumference of stator core 32) as shown in FIG. 3.</p>
    <p num="26">
      Each of conductor segments 33 is manufactured as follows.
      <br/>
      A copper plate is bent and press-formed into a U-shape so that opposite sides of outer-portion 33b and inner-portion 33a are inserted in one of slots 35 to be in contact with the parallel side walls of one of slots 33 via insulator 34.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      As shown in FIG. 6, each of two end portions 33d of one of conductor segments 33 is bent in the circumferential direction opposite to each other so that outer-portion 33b of the one of conductor segments 33 can be connected to inner-portion 33a of another of conductor segments extending from different one of slots 35 and inner-portion 33a of the former can be connected to outer-portion 33b of another of conductor segments 33 extending from different one of slots 35 at end portions 33d , thereby forming a ring of connected portions 33f, at a certain height from stator core 32.
      <br/>
      Then, connected portions 33f is dipped in a tank of liquid insulation material, and taken out from the tank to form uniform insulation film on connected portions 33f.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      Because all end portions 33d are disposed on the same end of stator core 32, the connection can be carried out by a TIG welder without turning the stator core 32.
      <br/>
      Because all conductor segments 33 are almost the same in shape and connected portions 33f are located at the same height, the dipping process for the insulation of all connected portions 33f can be carried out at the same time.
      <br/>
      Thus, the insulation process can be made simple, and production cost can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="29">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="30">
      The number of conductor members per slot can be increased to more than two.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 7, a stator according to a second embodiment of the invention has four conductor segments 133 aligned in the radial direction in one of slot 135.
      <br/>
      Conductor segments 133 have insulation coating thereon, and a insulator 134 is disposed between conductor segments 133 and inner wall of slot 135.
      <br/>
      The connected portions are shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Four conductor segments 133 in one of slots 135 extends alternately in the opposite circumferential directions.
      <br/>
      That is, the outermost segments extend clockwise, and the innermost segments extend counter-clockwise, as shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      End portions 133d of conductor segments 133 extending from one of slots 135 are respectively connected to end portions 133d extending from different one of slots 135 spaced apart at a certain pitch therefrom.
      <br/>
      In other words, the innermost conductor segments 133 are connected respectively to the second inner conductor segments 133, and third inner conductor segments 133 are connected respectively to the outermost conductor segments 133.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a plurality of connected portions 133f are formed into two rings so that each of connected portions 133f is spaced apart from another in both radial and circumferential directions.
      <br/>
      All the connected portions 133f are welded by a TIG welder to have edgeless raindrop shape in the manner substantially the same as the stator according to the first embodiment.
    </p>
    <p num="31">The above structure is effective to provide a smaller-sized vehicle alternator having the same number of slots 35, the distance between the connected portions is closer.</p>
    <p num="32">Third Embodiment</p>
    <p num="33">
      Conductor segments 33 illustrated in FIG. 2 can be separated at the middle of U-turn portion, as shown in FIG. 9.
      <br/>
      Such conductor segments 233 can be used to a stator according to a third embodiment of the invention.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 9, conductor segment 233 is composed of straight inner portion 233h and outer portions 233i extending axially outward from opposite ends of inner portion 233h.
      <br/>
      Outer portions 233i incline at a certain angle to the axial direction so that end portions 233d extending from one of slots can be welded to end portions 233d extending from another slot to form a stator winding.
      <br/>
      Connected portions 233f are formed at both ends of the stator core and cooled by the pair of cooling fans 11, 12 (FIG. 1).
      <br/>
      The connected portions 233f are also formed into an edgeless raindrop shape as described before.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Fourth Embodiment</p>
    <p num="35">Each connected portion 33f shown in FIG. 5B can be substituted by connected portion 333f shown in FIG. 11. Connected portion 333f is shaped like a slender pillow or a rugby ball, which is smaller than that shown in FIG. 5B. Connected portion 333f has a shape solidified from a liquid drop and has a smooth roundish surface.</p>
    <p num="36">
      End portion 333d before TIG welding is shown in FIG. 12. End portion 333d is made of copper and has edge 333g and sloped surfaces 333h.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, end portion 333d has a decreasing cross-section, as shown in FIG. 12. Adjacent two end portions 333d are put together to form a trapezoid.
      <br/>
      Because of a reduced volume to be welded by TIG welder, connected portion 333f becomes smaller than connected portion 33f shown in FIG. 5B. Connected portion 33f has width W which is equal to or smaller than double the width w of the conductor member.
      <br/>
      The thickness T of connected portion 333f is a little larger than the thickness t of the conductor member.
      <br/>
      These sizes varies a little between connected portions 333f, and the sloped surface may remain after the welding.
      <br/>
      However, the surfaces around the remaining sloped surface are not so sharp to be eliminated.
    </p>
    <p num="37">Edge 333g is entirely melted and sharp edges shown in FIG. 12 are eliminated.</p>
    <p num="38">
      Connected portion 333f is disposed so that the thickness W can be aligned with the radial direction of the stator.
      <br/>
      Because all connected portions 333f are disposed in the circumferential direction, compact connected portion as shown in FIG. 11 provides more spaces between connected portions 333f.
    </p>
    <p num="39">Fifth Embodiment</p>
    <p num="40">
      Each of connected portion 33f shown in FIG. 5B can be also substituted by connected portion 433f shown in FIG. 13. Connected portion 433f is shaped like a liquid ball hanging down, a raindrop, or a flat ball.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIGS. 14 and 15, connected portion 433f covers the edge and side surfaces of end portion 433d, thereby covering all sharp corner edges.
      <br/>
      Connected portion 433f has a shape solidified from a liquid drop and has a smooth roundish surface.
    </p>
    <p num="41">
      Connected portion 433f shown in FIG. 13 is formed according to the following steps.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 16, melted solder 430 is put in tank 440, and end portion 433d is dipped therein by a suitable length.
      <br/>
      Then, end portion 433d is taken out to coat melted solder 430 on end portion 433d.
      <br/>
      Melted solder 430 forms into the shape shown in FIG. 13 by its capillary attraction.
      <br/>
      The same shape is maintained when the solder cools and becomes solid.
      <br/>
      Solder 430 can be a soft solder, a copper solder, or the like.
    </p>
    <p num="42">Variations</p>
    <p num="43">As shown in FIGS. 17 and 18, end portion 533d or end portion 633d can be substituted for end portion 433d.</p>
    <p num="44">
      End portion 533d has sloped surfaces 533h to form a V-shaped convex edge.
      <br/>
      End portion 633d has inverted sloped surfaces 633h to form a V-shaped convex edge.
      <br/>
      These edges provide a wide surface to be covered by solder.
      <br/>
      Each of end portions 533d and 633d is dipped into melted solder 430 to the level indicated by a one-dot chain line.
      <br/>
      As a result, all sharp corner edges of end portions 533d and 633d are covered with the solder.
    </p>
    <p num="45">
      As shown in FIGS. 19-21, end portion 733d can be substituted for end portion 433d.
      <br/>
      End portion 733d is dipped into melted solder having lower viscosity than melted solder 430 of the precedent embodiments so that connected portion 733f can be formed more rectangular than connected portion 433f.
      <br/>
      This reduces the size of connected portion 733f, providing longer distance between adjoining connected portions 733d.
    </p>
    <p num="46">
      It is also possible to provide a single centrifugal cooling fan to cool connected portions 33f instead of a pair of cooling fans.
      <br/>
      The cooling fan can be axial flow fan also.
      <br/>
      The ball-shaped connected portions can be applied to an any kind of electric machine having water cooling structure.
      <br/>
      The cross-section of conductor segments 33 can be circular, elliptic or polygonal.
      <br/>
      A contactless arc welder other than TIG welder can be applicable to connect end portions 33d of conductor segments 33.
