      A power supply for high voltage, low current gas discharge tubes such as neon, argon, and mercury vapor.
      <br/>
      A free running, flyback oscillator, converts D.C. voltage energy into radio frequency energy by means of a compact, ferrite transformer and associated circuitry.
      <br/>
      The primary winding is tuned by a resonant capacitor and driven by a power transistor.
      <br/>
      A high voltage, centertapped winding of a ferrite transformer drives the gas tube load directly.
      <br/>
      A feedback winding arranged across the transistor base and emitter junction sustains oscillation and controls the drive level of the transistor by means of a regulating circuit which controls the amplitude of the current.
      <br/>
      Oscillator starting is achieved by means of an on-off switch which supplies a single starting pulse to the power transistor or by means of a time delayed starting pulse.
      <br/>
      A MOSFET transistor connected to the power transistor base and a current sensing transformer arranged in series with the primary winding, disables the power transistor momentarily at the end of a conducting cycle.
      <br/>
      Charge carries are depleted in the base-cathode region, resulting in resetting the transistor quickly such that it can withstand a forward voltage of 700 volts in the off state.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to power supplies and more particularly to a solid state, high efficient supply which converts D.C. energy to high frequency A.C. energy for the purpose of supplying gas discharge tubes with high voltage at relative low currents in a range of 15-55 milliamperes (ma) in a range of 15-115 watts.
      <br/>
      The high voltage may vary from one kilovolt to 10 kilovolts depending on the glass diameter, length, bends, type of gas, etc.
    </p>
    <p num="2">
      Upon ionization of a gas discharge tube by means of high voltage resulting in current flow, the atoms of neon are stimulated to emit an orange-red light.
      <br/>
      Other gases which glow when electrically energized are mercury vapor (blue-green), argon (pale blue), and a mixture of the two (deep blue).
      <br/>
      Pigmented fluorescent coatings are used with mercury vapor gas to produce many visible hues of light quite efficiently.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      One type of prior art power supply is simply 60 Hz transformers where 120 volts A.C. is applied to the primary of the transformer and the secondary winding output voltage is connected to the tube load.
      <br/>
      By utilizing a large ratio of primary secondary turns such as 50-100, high voltages are induced up to 10 kilovolts.
      <br/>
      Such systems are heavy, for example 10-12 pounds, dangerous, and may be as inefficient as 85% resulting in high internal temperatures and low reliability.
      <br/>
      Several sizes of transformers are available to prevent an underdrive or overdrive of the tube load.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      More recent solid state power supplies are lighter, more efficient, and operate silently compared with the 120 Hz audible noise from 60 Hz power supplies.
      <br/>
      However, specific problems are evident with such power supplies, such as: a) the series resonant type of oscillators employed result in a "beading" of the energized neon gas which is displeasing to the eye; (b) the lack of secondary short circuit protection so the system can fail when the secondary is shorted; (c) the lack of open circuit protection resulting in high voltages up to 16 kilovolts which is dangerous and may result in an arc and a fire; (d) the lack of protection from an open secondary lead or a broken tube which can cause a fire; (e) inadequate protection of persons who may come in contact with the high voltage by touching one of the leads; (f) the absence of a method to set and regulate the amplitude of current to a gas discharge tube often results in failing the tube load; and (g) the absence of circuit capability to connect a millampmeter for the purpose of adjusting the load current to a safe value.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      It has been found that tubes filled with mercury vapor gas tend to degrade when excess current is allowed to flow in the tubes due to excessive voltage.
      <br/>
      For example, such degradation has been observed in window neon signs with currents which exceed the nominal current by only 20%.
      <br/>
      The general symptom resulting from current overdrive is a dimming or darkening of specific sections of the tube caused by condensation of the mercury vapor which results in reducing the secondary emission of light from the flourescent coating.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Gas discharge tubes have a negative coefficient of resistance with current.
      <br/>
      That is, the tube's resistance decreases as the current through it increases which suggests that a runaway condition exists if the current is not regulated.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      The glass used for window neon signage range from 9-12 mm.
      <br/>
      High voltage, gas discharge tubes used for lighting are generally 15 or 18 mm's, are filled with mercury gas, and emit white light.
      <br/>
      The area of the glass inside diameter determines the amount of high voltage and resultant current which will be tolerated by mercury vapor sections of signs or lighting systems.
      <br/>
      In commercial practice, the outside diameter of the glass is used as reference rather than the inside diameter.
      <br/>
      The following table illustrates the nominal and damaging currents for lighting devices of various sizes.

      Neon gas tubing is not easily damaged by excessive voltage and resultant current, however neon and mercury vapor sections generally are arranged in series in signage resulting in the need for regulation of the current because of the mercury vapor sections.
      <br/>
      Also, when more than one section of tubing is used to configure the sign, such as four sections of different colors, the smallest diameter mercury vapor section determines the safe current limit.
      <br/>
      Often tubes are bent sharply during the manufacturing process resulting in reducing the area of the tube at these points by the equivalent of 1-2 mm's.

      The power supply circuit 30 is shown generally in FIG. 1.

      Moving the switch to "on" results in opening armature 114, removing the base short of transistor Q1.
      <br/>
      Simultaneously armature 118 connects to position 122 of switch SW which allows the voltage in capacitor C1 to discharge through diode D1, switch SW, opto LED Q2, and the base-emitter junction of transistor Q1; enabling transistor Q1 and oscillator 34.

    <p num="47">
      When transistor Q1 is turned on by the starting pulse from the on-off switch SW, 160 volts D.C. is applied across the primary winding L5 and its resonant capacitor C6 introducing sufficient energy to cause a damped wave oscillation.

      All windings mutually coupled to L5 are energized including feedback winding L1 which is required to sustain oscillation.
      <br/>
      Winding L1 connects directly to the transistor Q1 base through resistor R3 and schottky diode D4.
      <br/>
      On the opposite side of winding L1, a closed series circuit is arranged through a network consisting of resistor R4, resistor R5 and capacitor C8 in parallel, and opto silicon controlled rectifier (S.C.R.) Q2' to circuit common 50.

      Voltage is induced into the oscillator feedback winding L1 and auxiliary winding L6 synchronous with the starting pulse.

      <br/>
      The 8.2 volt charge in capacitor C9 serves as -8.2 a volt D.C. supply for the current regulator 42.

      Until opto transistor Q6' conducts, which will subsequently be discussed, MOSFET Q8 is turned on completing the series oscillator feedback path from circuit common, MOSFET Q8, winding L1, resistor R3, diode D4, base-emitter junction of transistor Q1, and the parallel configuration of resistor R1 and capacitor C7 to circuit common.
      <br/>
      The resultant positive feedback to transistor Q1 sustains oscillation.

      <br/>
      A current calibrating potentiometer R12 shunts LED Q6 providing an adjustment of the current through opto LED Q6 which varies the resistance of opto transistor Q6' in the current regulator 42.
      <br/>
      A digital V.O.M. 146, adjusted to read D.C. ma, directly measures the current in load 38 when connected across resistor R11.
      <br/>
      The amount of load current can be set to the desired value by simply adjusting potentiometer R12 while viewing the meter.
      <br/>
      The brightness of the tube 38 varies in proportion to the meter current.
      <br/>
      Increasing the current increases the high voltage across the tube load.
    </p>
    <p num="53">
      The value of resistor R11 is not critical and may have a range of 100-500 ohms.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment of the invention, a 200 ohm resistor was used.
      <br/>
      When the meter 146 is used, practically all of the current flows through the meter due to its low resistance.
      <br/>
      When the meter is not used, all of the load current flows through resistor R11 producing a small drop of 5 volts if the load current is 25 ma (E=IR).

      Opto diode Q6 is an LED whose light output is directly proportional to the current through it.

      The emitter-collector resistance of opto transistor Q6' is directly proportional to the light received from LED Q6.
      <br/>
      When the load current through tube 38 tends to decrease, reducing the light to opto transistor Q6', the emitter-collector resistance increases.
      <br/>
      Referring to the current regulator 42, an increase in the transistor Q6' resistance increases the base drive voltage of transistor Q7 increasing its emitter voltage and the gate-source voltage of MOSFET Q8.
      <br/>
      The source-drain resistance of Q8 reduces increasing the feedback current to the power transistor Q1 resulting in an increase of current through transistor Q1 and the primary winding L5, as well as the high voltage current to load 38.
      <br/>
      Therefore any tendency for the load current through tube load 38 to change is countered by an opposite change resulting from the current regulation of circuit 42.

      At 7 volts, UJT Q10 fires discharging capacitor C12 through the gate-cathode junction of triac Q4, shunted by resistor R15.

      An unbalance results from a human touch of either end of the tube load 38, an open lead 150 or 154, or a broken tube.

      If the unbalance causes a current flow of 2 ma in LED Q3, the charge in capacitor C12 will exceed the 7 volt threshold of UJT Q10 causes it to conduct, enabling triac Q4 and disabling power transistor Q1 and oscillator 34.

      Without a timer to restart the oscillator, a single operation of the failsafe circuit renders the oscillator inoperative until the on-off switch SW is turned off, then on.

      A timer is illustrated in block 54.

      Its purpose is to provide a starting pulse to transistor Q1 to restart the oscillator 34 after a delay of five seconds.
      <br/>
      After the initial turn off by the failsafe circuit 58, the five second timer 54 attempts to restart the oscillator 34 each five seconds until the problem is cleared.

      <br/>
      When the oscillator 34 is disabled by the failsafe circuit 58, transistor Q11 ceases conduction and capacitor C13 charges through resistor R16.

      Opto LED Q12 is pulsed on each time that timer 54 operates which automatically causes opto transistor Q11' to conduct discharging capacitor C13 and resetting the 5 second timer, otherwise the failsafe circuit would not reset; disallowing the failsafe circuit from interrogating the load 38 and associated circuitry.

      <br/>
      Very little current flows through the regulator opto LED Q6 under this condition, resulting in opto transistor Q6' being high in resistance causing transistor Q7 to develop in excess of 6.2 volts at its emitter and at the gate of MOSFET Q8 resulting in maximum feedback drive to transistor Q1 and excessive high voltage.

      Once turned on, triac Q9 cannot turn off if any voltage remains between its anode and cathode.

      Under this condition, the failsafe circuit 58 operates normally and disables the oscillator 34 if either high voltage leads 150 or 154 are touched.

      The current regulator circuit 42 includes thermistor R19 which provides thermal compensation of optocoupler Q6' which has a positive temperature coefficient; that is, the collector-emitter resistance of Q6' increases as the temperature inside the power supply housing rises as a result of a change in load 38 or an ambient temperature change without thermal compensation, an increase in the opto transistor Q6' resistance boosts the feedback drive to transistor Q1 increasing the high voltage and current to load 38.
      <br/>
      To off-set an increase in the opto transistor Q6' resistance, thermistor R19 shunts opto transistor Q6' and has a negative temperature coefficient.
      <br/>
      In the experimental embodiment of the invention, R19 was 10 K ohms and decreased 4%/ (degree)  C. between 25  (degree)  C. &amp; 100  (degree)  C. The thermal compensation provided by thermistor R19 allows the current regulator 42 to meet a specification of +1 ma with load changes of 15-115 watts or an ambient temperature change of  +- 25  (degree)  C.

      Power transistor Q1 is an inexpensive bipolar transistor commonly used in various forms of switching power supplies generally designed for specific D.C. voltage loads such as personal computers.
      <br/>
      When driven off, it must withstand forward voltages up to 800 volts D.C. and 3 amperes peak when driven on.
      <br/>
      In the experimental embodiment, transistor Q1 is mounted to an aluminum, extruded heatsink which dissipates about 3 watts with a tube load of 110 watts.
      <br/>
      The plastic enclosure of the power supply is slotted providing sufficient draft for air to flow across the heatsink cooling the power transistor Q1 and MOSFET current regulator Q8 .
      <br/>
      Transistor Q1 mounts on one end of the heatsink and MOSFET Q8 on the opposite end.

      In the experimental embodiment, the power transformer 98 is mechanically configured in a rectangular shape with two transformer bobbins positioned over air gaps resulting from butting two ferrite U cores together.
      <br/>
      As mentioned, the gaps are 0.060" and consist of phenolic spacers with excellent dielectric properties.
      <br/>
      The primary bobbin has individual slots for the primary winding L5, feedback winding L1, and auxiliary winding L6; all wound with litz wire which reduces heat loss.
      <br/>
      The secondary bobbin is divided into 6 slots with 4 termination pins for the high voltage windings L2 and L3.
      <br/>
      Winding L2 is wound in 3 slots on one end of the bobbin and winding L3 is similarly wound on the other end.
      <br/>
      Windings L2 and L3 are wound from the center of the bobbin to either end to insure equal inductance and distributed capacitance to earth ground of both windings.
      <br/>
      The centertap traces 130 and 62 terminate on the printed circuit board providing for a series connection of rectifier bridge D8.
      <br/>
      GTO-10, 10 kilovolt cable terminate the ends of windings L2 and L3 at traces 150 and 154.
    </p>
    <p num="70">
      Secondary windings L2 and L3 are preferably epoxy encapsulated.
      <br/>
      In the experimental embodiment of the invention, the wound secondary bobbin inserts into a potting cup which provides a hole on either side of the cup to receive extensions of the secondary bobbin which protrude through the cup holes.
      <br/>
      An inner hole through the tube of the bobbin allows installation of the ferrite cores after the encapsulation process.
      <br/>
      A suitable epoxy material, which has been desired, is metered into the cup and bobbin while mounted to a fixture in a vacuum chamber where all air is removed from the windings and epoxy.
      <br/>
      A heat cure is completed after removing the bobbin and cup combination from the vacuum chamber.
      <br/>
      During encapsulation, all 4 leads are encapsulated by the epoxy to complete the seal of the high voltage windings.

      Active, electronic regulation of the load current is desirable to achieve reliable, predictable operation of power supply 30.

      The circuit 34 is inherently a passive, constant current source which is necessary in driving gas discharge loads where the tube loads are resistive, vary over a wide range, and have a negative resistance coefficient in relationship to their current and power.

    <p num="72">
      In the experimental embodiment of the invention, FIGS. 10 through 13 illustrate the dynamic curves of four different sign systems where the current is varied and the current and wattage are metered.
      <br/>
      The resistance of the load and the voltage across the load are calculated by:
      <br/>
      E=W/I and R=E/I

      Using 25 ma as the reference current, sign A parameters are: E=3.75 kilovolts, R=150 K ohms, &amp; W=94.
      <br/>
      It is observed that the load resistance decreases as the current through the load increases.
      <br/>
      Expressed as E=IR, the high voltage curve should vary only slightly as the current varies from 20 ma to 30 ma and the wattage from 70 to 115.
      <br/>
      The high voltage varies from 3.4 kilovolts to 3.8 kilovolts which is a change of only 400 volts over a 45 watt range.

      The equivalent circuit FIG. 15 illustrates that an inductive reactance of 120 K ohm appears in series with any load 38 connected across the secondary windings L2 and L3 which clearly demonstrates that circuit FIG. 15 is a constant current source in a passive sense.
      <br/>
      The circuit can tolerate wide variations of loads in terms of wattage without large changes in current A shorted load 38 between terminals 150 and 154 results in all of the induced voltage EZ being dropped across XL of L2 and L3.

    <p num="77">
      Observing a wattmeter connected to the input of D.C. power supply 70 reveals that very little energy is dissipated with a shorted load circuit and no damage results.
      <br/>
      All of the induced voltage in L2 and L3 is dropped across the sum of their respective inductive reactances with a zero power factor: Watts=EI * P.F.=0. The limitation on the current is 120 K ohms of X and only 300 ohms of resistance, which is the resistance of inductors L2 &amp; L3.
      <br/>
      Even if the secondary current increased to 50 ma when shorted, practically zero power results because P=I R=0.75 watts.

      Current regulator 42 prevents the short circuit current from increasing above the set point which limits the short circuit load power to about 0.4 watt.

      In the experimental embodiment of the invention, the upper limit of the wattage and current control range is 115 watts.

      At 115 watts of output power, MOSFET Q8' has less than 1 ohm of source to drain resistance representing a full "on" condition and the limit of its control.
      <br/>
      Under this condition, R16 represents the only resistance in series with feedback winding L1 and the transistor Q1 base and therefore determines the upper load range of the power supply 30.

    <p num="81">
      If ten tube sections equal to 11.5 watts each at 25 ma are arranged in series and connected to high voltage traces 150 and 154, each 11.5 watt section represents a voltage=11.5/25 ma=460 volts drop and a resistance=460 volts/25 ma=18.4 K ohms.
      <br/>
      The total wattage, volts, and resistance of the ten sections are: 115 watts, 4.6 kilovolts, and 184 K ohms of resistance.

    <p num="82">
      Adding one additional section of 11.5 watts to the load results in a drop in current to the load because the high voltage limit is 4.6 kilovolts and the load resistance has increased by 18.4 K ohms.

      Reducing the load from ten sections to three by successively removing one section results in a constant current of 25 ma and a wattage of 11.5 watts per section with normal brightness.

      As discussed earlier, the oscillator is started by a single pulse from the on-off switch or from a timer whose output is delayed 5 seconds.
      <br/>
      Transistor Q1 conducts resulting in 160 volts D.C. being applied across the primary winding L5 paralleled by resonant capacitor C6 resulting in a damped wave oscillation of L5 and C6.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      The waveform illustrated in FIG. 2 is applied regeneratively to the base of power transistor Q1 resulting in sustained oscillation.
      <br/>
      The amplitude is 30 volts peak.
      <br/>
      The resultant transistor Q1 base voltage and current are represented by FIGS. 3 and 4 and the emitter current and voltage by FIGS. 6 and 7.
      <br/>
      After turn on, the current through transistor Q1 and inductor L5 conduct linearly as shown in FIG. 6 until winding L5 begins to saturate causing the I/E relationship to change slightly.
      <br/>
      Pulse transformer 106 detects the change instantly with a one turn primary winding L4 which is mutually coupled to L7 resulting in the voltage pulse shown in FIG. 5.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 3 the amplitude 15 volts peak; in FIG. 4, the average drive current is 250 ma peak; in FIG. 5 the peak voltage is +6.8 volts; and in FIG. 6 peak current is 3 amperes when the tube load is 90 watts.
      <br/>
      The +6.8 volt pulse turns on MOSFET Q5 whose source-drain junction shorts the transistor Q1 gate to circuit common and reverse biases transistor Q1 opening the emitter-collector junction.

      The effect of the sense pulse illustrated in FIG. 5 is shown in FIG. 4 where the base current is turned off removing the base voltage illustrated in FIG. 3, and resulting in cutting off the emitter current shown in FIG. 6 and beginning the flyback voltage shown in FIG. 7.

      FIG. 8 illustrates the resonant current in capacitor C6 which conducts during the flyback period and initiates positive feedback from winding L1 to start conduction in Q1 for the succeeding cycle.

      In FIG. 7 the peak voltage is 600 volts with a 90 watt load and in FIG. 8 the peak-peak current is 4 amperes.

      Generally, it is one alternation of a sine wave which is automatically averaged by the high voltage windings L2 and L3 and the load such that equal and opposite average currents flow in the load.
      <br/>
      No D.C. component is present.

      Any D.C. component causes electroplating and eventual failure of the tube or electrode.

      The energy supplied by the power transistor Q1 to the primary resonant circuit comprising winding L5 and capacitor C6 equals the energy dissipated in the load 38, allowing for small losses resulting from the remaining circuit.

      When load resistance is decreased, the reflected impedance from windings L2 and L3 reduce the primary XL increasing the primary current.
      <br/>
      If the increase does not satisfy the set current of the load, such as 25 ma, the current regulator 42 increases the flyback drive to power transistor Q1 until the load current condition is satisfied.
