      A three-piece thread wound golf ball including a central solid core portion composed mainly of polybutadiene having a Shore D hardness of 55-75 and increased diameter (34.3-38.1 mm) and reduced specific gravity (1.20-1.25) compared to traditional three-piece wound golf balls.
      <br/>
      The solid core portion is wound with an elastomeric thread material to achieve a core and winding layer diameter of 39.1-40.6 mm.
      <br/>
      A dimpled cover portion formed of a thermoplastic material overlies the winding layer.
      <br/>
      The three-piece thread wound golf ball construction provides desirable increased moment of inertia and spin characteristics for the ball.
      <br/>
      The resulting golf ball characteristics are such that when hit with a driver, other woods or the longer iron clubs it performs like a distance two-piece golf ball; when hit with mid-iron clubs it performs like a two-piece Hi-spin or a soft covered multi layered golf ball; and when hit with short iron clubs it performs much like a Balata wound golf ball.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      This invention pertains to an improved three-piece wound golf ball construction including a solid center core, an intermediate thread wound layer, and an outer cover piece.
      <br/>
      It pertains particularly to such a wound golf ball in which the core has larger diameter and decreased specific gravity so as to provide increased moment of inertia, spin rate and improved trajectory distance after being hit by any of various golf clubs.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Conventional known golf balls have either two-piece construction consisting of a center core and an outer cover with multiple dimples provided on its outer surface, or have three-piece construction consisting of a center core, an intermediate portion which may be solid or have elastomeric thread winding, and a solid dimpled cover.
      <br/>
      The cores are usually made of natural or synthetic rubber and may be either solid or have a liquid/paste form.
      <br/>
      The cover material is usually Balata or an ionomer in combination with a suitable filler material.
      <br/>
      Variations in the chemical or physical properties of the ball materials or their physical orientation can bring about changes in the golf ball characteristics, such as feel, flight distance, rebound coefficient, durability, moment of inertia, spin etc. as has been generally described in various prior art patents.

      Although golf balls having various constructions and characteristics are known, important deficiencies have been found by players to exist in these known golf ball constructions and flight characteristics.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the two-piece golf balls are far inferior in the controllability that is required when a shot is made with the middle iron or short iron clubs.
      <br/>
      In addition, a two-piece golf ball provides a poor shot feeling to the player.
      <br/>
      Known three-piece Balata golf balls exhibit spin rates that are too great for good flight distance when hit with a Driver and long iron clubs.
      <br/>
      Thus, desirable improvements in golf ball construction and spin characteristics, all achieved at reduced ball manufacturing costs, have been sought.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="12">
      This invention provides an improved solid three-piece golf ball construction having a desirable combination of characteristics, and which exhibits various desirable and advantageous flight characteristics depending upon the type of golf club with which it is struck.
      <br/>
      Specifically, when the present ball is hit with a driver, other woods or longer iron club, it desirably performs much like a distance two-piece golf ball; when hit with a mid-iron club, it performs much like a two-piece Hi-spin golf ball and soft covered multi-layered ball; and when hit with a short iron or putter, the ball performs much like a three-piece liquid core Balata wound golf ball.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      These desired flight characteristics for the spherical three-piece wound golf ball of this invention are achieved by providing a ball having a central solid homogeneous core which is substantially spherical and has a significantly increased diameter of 1.350-1.500 inch (34.3-38.1 mm), and preferably has 1.400-1.450 inch (35.6-36.8 mm) core diameter.
      <br/>
      The solid core is composed mainly of polybutadiene having some desirable additives, and has a specific gravity of 1.20-1.25 and a Shore D durometer hardness of 55-75, and a compression of 59-75 on a Atti compression tester.
      <br/>
      Suitable broad and preferred ranges for the chemical compositions for the golf ball core are provided in Table 1 below.

      The ball core diameter is significantly larger and the core specific gravity is significantly lower than that for three-piece solid core wound golf balls which are normally available on the market at the present time.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the ratio of the ball solid core diameter or volume to its specific gravity is significantly greater than for other known golf balls.
      <br/>
      Specifically, for the ball diameter expressed in inches, this ratio should be in a broad range of 0.9/1-1.30/1, and preferably should be 1.0/1-1.25/1. The larger solid core diameter and its lower specific gravity, in combination with the thread type for the thread-wound intermediate layer and the outer solid cover material and thickness, results in a significant desirable transfer of the ball weight and moment of inertia towards its peripheral portion.
      <br/>
      Consequently, there is a desirable increase in the total moment of inertia for the ball, which results in a corresponding increase in the initial relative spin rate of the ball after being hit with various golf clubs, as compared to other known golf balls.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      According to the present invention, the ball solid central core portion having 1.35-1.50 inch (34.3-38.1 mm) diameter is thread wound to a diameter of 1.540-1.600 inch (39.1-40.6 mm) and preferably to 1.560-1.580 inch (39.6-40.1 mm) diameter.
      <br/>
      The winding thread is a high velocity elastomeric thread material used to provide a wound intermediate portion.
      <br/>
      The thread winding material consists of blended natural and synthetic rubber having an elongation of about 800-1,000%, tensile strength of about 4,000-5,000 psi, and a rectangular cross-section dimension of 0.0625 (+/-0.002) inches * 0.024 (+/-0.006) inches.
      <br/>
      The ball cover layer or portion consists of a solid thermoplastic material having a density of 1.00-1.04 g/cm3, a flexural modulus of 5,000-10,000 psi, and a Shore D durometer hardness of 55-65.
      <br/>
      The surface of the cover portion has many small shallow dimples occupying 70-80% of the ball surface area, the dimples having a total volume of 400-500 mm3.
      <br/>
      The finished golf ball has an outer diameter of 1.680-1.688 inches (42.7-42.9 mm), a weight of 44.5-45.9 gr, a density of 1.090-1.113 g/cm3, and an Atti compression reading of 85+/-15 points.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      One useful material blend for the golf ball cover portion contains by weight 25%+/-5% by weight of a sodium ionomer (Dupont Surlyn 8140), 69%+/-5% of a zinc ionomer (Dupont Surlyn 9320) and 6% of a sodium ionomer (Dupont Surlyn 8660) in combination with 58% titanium dioxide.
      <br/>
      Another useful blend for the ball cover contains by weight 50%+/-5% of a sodium ionomer (Dupont Surlyn 8140), 44%+/-5% of a zinc ionomer (Dupont Surlyn 9320), and 6% of a sodium ionomer (Dupont Surlyn 8660) in combination with 58% titanium dioxide.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      This invention advantageously provides a three-piece wound golf ball having a solid center core of increased core diameter and reduced specific gravity and an elastomeric thread wound intermediate portion, which results in a desirable increased moment of inertia and spin characteristic for the ball during flight after being struck by a selected golf club.
      <br/>
      The ball thereby provides an overall desirable combination of characteristics for use under a wide range of playing conditions.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Another advantage of this invention is that three-piece golf balls are usually made with a small diameter center of only about 1.0-1.06 inch diameter, which is typically either a lively rubber ball or a liquid-filled hollow sphere.
      <br/>
      During ball manufacture, these centers must be frozen and a considerable amount of thread must be wound onto the center to bring it up to an established diameter.
      <br/>
      But for the present invention, the ball manufacturing costs are reduced by cost of the medium used to freeze the centers.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, because the center is larger in diameter, the amount and cost of the winding thread being applied to the center core and the time needed to wind it to the established size are both desirably reduced.

    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading>
    <p num="20">
      This invention will now be described further with reference to the following drawings, in which:
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 and 2 each show a cross-sectional view of a conventional two-piece high spin golf ball and a conventional three-piece golf ball having a liquid center, respectively;
      <br/>
      FIG. 3 shows a cross-sectional view of an improved three-piece golf ball having larger solid center core and a thread wound intermediate layer all constructed according to the present invention; and

      FIG. 4 shows golf ball comparative initial spin rates after being struck by the various numbered standard golf clubs.
    </p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="21">
      As shown by FIG. 1, a conventional two-piece golf ball 10 includes a solid core 11 and an outer molded cover 12, but without an intermediate layer or portion.
      <br/>
      The conventional three-piece golf ball 14, as shown by FIG. 2, includes a liquid core center 15, a thread wound intermediate layer 16, and an outer molded cover 18.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      The present invention is directed to an improved three-piece thread-wound golf ball 20, as shown in cross-section by FIG. 3.
      <br/>
      The ball comprises a solid center core 22 formed substantially of polybutadiene material and having an increased diameter of between 1.35-1.50 inches (34.3-38.1 mm), with the preferred core diameter being 1.400-1.450 inches (35.6-36.8 mm).
      <br/>
      The core portion 22 is surrounded by an intermediate thread-wound portion 24, which is surrounded by an outer solid cover 26 on which is provided multiple shallow dimples 28 covering the outer surface of the ball.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      An important characteristic of the inner core portion 22 is that it has significantly larger diameter and lower specific gravity than cores which are provided for known three-piece wound golf balls at the present time.
      <br/>
      The core 22 larger diameter and lower specific gravity in combination with the diameter and type of winding thread used in the intermediate portion 24 and the material for outer cover 26, results in a significant proportional transfer of weight of the golf ball outwardly towards its perimeter.
      <br/>
      As a result, there is an increase in the moment of inertia for the ball, and consequently there is an increase in the initial spin rate of the ball 20 after being hit with a particular golf club.
      <br/>
      This golf ball construction provides a greater degree of control of the ball spin and trajectory flight distance than is provided by other known golf balls.
      <br/>
      The ball increased core diameter and reduced specific gravity has a significant importance when used in combination with the intermediate thread winding and cover dimensions and materials.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      The outer portions of the three-piece wound golf ball as shown in FIG. 3 includes the intermediate portion 24 which is wound tightly with a high velocity type elastomer thread material compared of blended natural and synthetic rubbers, and the outside cover 26 which exhibits the characteristics of a Balata cover material.
      <br/>
      The thread winding material employed provides an increase in initial ball velocity after being hit by a club.
      <br/>
      The ball cover is formed of a thermoplastic material having a density of 1.00-1.04 gm/cm3 and many shallow dimples; and is able to impart flight control over a trajectory distance similar to that for conventional two-piece, multi-layer, and Balata three-piece wound balls.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      Because of the increased diameter and lower specific gravity of the ball center core portion, it has been found that the golf ball according to this invention provides improved spin characteristics when struck by various golf clubs, including a No. 1 wood driver, and No. 3, 6 and 9 iron clubs.
      <br/>
      Specifically, the initial ball spin rate expressed in revolutions per minute after being struck by the higher numbered clubs, i.e. by the 3-iron, 6-iron and 9-iron clubs, exceeds the ball initial spin rate after being struck with a No. 1 Driver club by minimum initial spin ratios as listed in Table 2 below.

      More specifically, as generally shown in Table 3 and FIG. 4, the ball initial spin rate expressed in revolutions per minute show that the ball construction of the improved three-piece wound golf ball spins much like a two piece distance golf ball when hit with a Driver, and long irons, like a two-piece Hi Spin golf ball when hit with mid-iron clubs, and when hit with a short iron club, the ball performs much like a Balata wound golf ball.

      From the above comparative ball flight distance results per Table 4, it is seen that the golf ball of the present invention has the favorable flight characteristic of the Balata covered ball and also the flight distance of a two-piece and multi-layer golf ball.
      <br/>
      The combinations of elements as described provide a golf ball that at least substantially duplicates and even improves upon the desirable properties of the Balata covered ball while overcoming the expense and lack of durability associated with the Balata covered ball.
