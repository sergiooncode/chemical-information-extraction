    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="10">Embodiment 1</p>
    <p num="11">Embodiment 1 of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. 1 to 15.</p>
    <p num="12">FIG. 1 is a diagram of the complete construction of a direct-current electric motor being a dynamo-electric machine according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention, where reference number 1 denotes a yoke, 2 denotes permanent magnets secured around the inner circumferential surface of the yoke 1, 3 denotes a rotor shaft disposed so as to rotate freely within the yoke, 4 denotes a rotor core secured to the rotor shaft 3, 5 denotes rotor windings composed of enamel-coated copper wire wound into slots in the rotor core 4, 6 denotes a commutator disposed at one end of the rotor core 4 and secured to the rotor shaft 3, 7 denotes an equalizer disposed in close proximity to the commutator 6 and secured to the rotor shaft 3, and 8 denotes brushes pressed against the surface of the commutator 6.</p>
    <p num="13">
      FIG. 2 is a partial enlargement of the commutator 6 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The commutator 6 comprises a plurality of commutator segments a disposed with even pitch around the circumference thereof, and a commutator molded portion 10 disposed inside the commutator segments 9 for securing the commutator segments 9 and insulating between the commutator segments 9.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 3 is a cross-section of the commutator 6 in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      Receiving portions 11 for keeping the commutator segments 9 mutually separated and for securing the commutator segments 9 and the commutator molded portion 10 are formed at the roots of the commutator segments 9.
      <br/>
      During insertion molding, resin injected into the mold flows between the receiving portions 11 and becomes the portion supporting the commutator after the resin sets.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a shaft bore 12 for the passage of the rotor shaft 3 is formed radially inside the commutator molded portion 10.
      <br/>
      In other words, the commutator molded body 10 serves the function of supporting the commutator segments 9 against centrifugal force, the function of keeping the commutator segments 9 mutually separated, and the function of securing the commutator 6 to the rotor shaft 3.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      FIGS. 4 to 7 show the equalizers 7 from FIGS. 1 and 2.
      <br/>
      The equalizer 7 comprise a plurality of laminated printed circuit boards 15 including connecting plates 14 wherein conductor layers are formed on insulating substrates 13 by a process such as etching, etc.
      <br/>
      Passage bores 16 are formed with even pitch around a peripheral portion of the insulating substrate 13.
      <br/>
      The number of passage bores 16 corresponds to the number of commutator segments, and because this embodiment employs a 4-pole, 22-slot, lap-wound direct-current electric motor having 22 commutator segments, it is formed with 22 passage bores 16.
      <br/>
      The connecting plates 14 are formed in a pattern so as to continuously link commutator segments 9 which are to have the same electric potential.
      <br/>
      In other words, protrusions 17 protruding radially outwards are formed in mutually opposite positions, and passage bores 18 are formed in these protrusions 17.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      The equalizer 7 may be formed by laminating a plurality of printed circuit boards 15 machined into circular shapes, or by disposing a plurality of connecting plates by etching on a single insulating plate, laminating a plurality of such insulating plates, then separating them into individual equalizers 7 by punching, etc.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, if the thickness t of the connecting plates 14 is 70  MU m and the width W of the protrusions 17 of the connecting plates 14 is 5 mm, the cross-sectional area of the protrusions 17 is 0.35 mm2, which ensures an electrical current capacity of generally the same level as a conducting wire 0.7 mm in diameter.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      Next, the method of connecting the commutator segments 9 and the connecting plates 14 of the printed circuit boards 15 will be explained with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10. As shown in FIG. 8, round rod-shaped connecting projections 19 are integrally preformed on the commutator segments 9.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, conducting films 20 are formed on the inner walls of the passage bores 18 of the connecting plates 14 and the passage bores 16 of the insulating substrates 13 overlapping the passage bores 18, respectively.
      <br/>
      The commutator segments 9 and the connecting plates 14 are electrically connected by pressing the connecting projections 19 into the passages formed by the overlapping of the passage bores 18 and the passage bores 16.
    </p>
    <p num="18">Moreover, the connecting projections 19 also pass through the passage bores 16 of the insulating plates 13 which do not overlap the passage bores 18 of the connecting plates, and these connecting projections 19 electrically connect commutator segments 9 which are to have the same electric potential by means of other connecting plates 14.</p>
    <p num="19">
      FIG. 11 shows the positional relationship between the commutator segments 9 and the connecting plates 14.
      <br/>
      In the equalizer 7 in this embodiment, eleven connecting plates 14a to 14k are stacked in layers, and the protrusions 17 on each of these connecting plates 14a to 14k electrically connect commutator segments 9 positioned on opposite sides.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the order in which the connecting plates 14a to 14k are laminated is arbitrary.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      In an electric motor of the above construction, because the equalizer is disposed at one end of the commutator 6 and are at the opposite end from the risers 21 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the equalizer 7 does not interfere with the winding operation during the process of installing the rotor windings 5 on the rotor core 4.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, because the outer diameter of the equalizer 7 is smaller than the outer diameter of the brush contact surfaces of the commutator 6, it is no longer necessary to move the brushes 8 radially outwards beyond the radius of the commutator when the rotor is inserted into the stator during the assembly process, enabling improvements in the production of the motor.
    </p>
    <p num="21">Moreover, the connecting projections 19 are not limited to round rod shapes, and may be square bar shapes like the connecting projections 22 shown in FIG. 12. In that case, because the corner portions of the connecting projections 22 only partially bond to the conducting films 20, the connecting projections 22 can be more easily inserted into the passages.</p>
    <p num="22">Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 13, the connecting projections 19 may also be secured to the printed circuit boards 15 by means of brazing, etc., using a brazing agent 23 such as solder, copper, etc.</p>
    <p num="23">
      In addition, the roots of the commutator segments 9 of the commutator 6 are formed into a receiving portions 11, but the commutator 24 shown in FIG. 14 may also be used.
      <br/>
      That is, in the commutator 24, hook shaped fastening portions 26 are formed at both ends of commutator segments 25.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      Furthermore, in this embodiment, a 4-pole, 22-slot example was given, but application to other numbers of poles and slots is possible.
      <br/>
      For example, FIG. 15 is a front elevation of a printed circuit board 28 for an equalizer 27 applied to an 8pole, 24 slot electric motor, and because there are a total of six sets of four commutator segments which are to have the same electric potential, four commutator segments are electrically connected by the connecting plate of each single printed circuit board 28.
    </p>
    <p num="25">Embodiment 2</p>
    <p num="26">FIGS. 16 and 17 show Embodiment 2 of the present invention, which will be explained using the same numbering for portions the same as or corresponding to those of Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="27">In this embodiment, an equalizer 30 constructed by laminating four printed circuit boards 31 are used in an electric motor in which the number of poles is four and the number of slots Ns is 22.</p>
    <p num="28">In the equalizer 30, a commutator segment 9a is connected to a commutator segment 9l by a connecting plate 32a of a printed circuit board 31, a commutator segment 9d is connected to a commutator segment 9o by a connecting plate 32b, a commutator segment 9g is connected to a commutator segment 9r by a connecting plate 32c, and a commutator segment 9j is connected to a commutator segment 9u by a connecting plate 32d, respectively.</p>
    <p num="29">In this manner, although it is normally desirable to connect all commutator segments 9 which are to have the same electric potential, it is possible to omit some connections where necessary.</p>
    <p num="30">FIG. 18 is a conceptual diagram for finding the lower limit to the number of the connecting plates 32 and represents a planimetric development at the contact surface between the brushes 8 and the commutator segments 9.</p>
    <p num="31">
      In FIG. 18, the maximum number of commutator segments 9 which can be present between the brushes 8 is given by a natural number n satisfying the expression
      <br/>
      (n BETA +(n-1) GAMMA ) &lt;= (360/(2P)- ALPHA )  (1)
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      where P is the number of pairs of poles,
      <br/>
      Ns is the number of slots,
      <br/>
      ALPHA  is the brush angle at the contact surface between the brushes 8 and the commutator segments 9,
      <br/>
      BETA  is the angle covered by each commutator segment 9, and
      <br/>
      GAMMA  is the angle between commutator segments 9.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      If the number K of connecting plates 32 relative to n, is a whole number satisfying the expression
      <br/>
      (Ns/(n * P)) &lt;= K &lt;= (Ns/P)  (2),
      <br/>
      then at least one of the commutator segments 9 present between the brushes 8 will be connected by a connecting plate 32.
    </p>
    <p num="34">Moreover, this embodiment has been explained using a 4-pole electric motor in which the number of slots Ns is 22 and the number of brushes 8 is 4, but the embodiment is not limited to this configuration, and any configuration may be used provided that the number K of connecting plates 32 is a whole number satisfying expression (2).</p>
    <p num="35">
      Moreover, the upper limit to the number of connecting plates 32 is generally given to be (Ns/P), but commutator segments 9 which are to have the same electric potential may be connected by a plurality of connecting plates.
      <br/>
      In that case, the current capacity of each of the connecting plates can be reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="36">Furthermore, in each of the above embodiments, the equalizers 7, 27, 30 are disposed only on the same end as the commutators 6, 24, but a separate equalizer may be used in addition to these in the vicinity of the rotor windings at the opposite end from the commutator.</p>

    <p num="38">
      FIG. 19 is a partial enlargement of a commutator assembly for an electric motor according to Embodiment 3 of the present invention.
      <br/>
      In the equalizer 35 of this embodiment, connector pins 33, separate members from the commutator segments 9, are used instead of the connecting projections 19, 22.
      <br/>
      The connector pins 33 are secured in pin insertion recesses 34 predisposed in the commutator segments 9 using a securing means such as brazing, soldering, press fitting, threading, etc.
      <br/>
      Since the cross-sectional shape and function of the connector pins 33 is the same as that of the connecting projections 19, 22 in Embodiment 1, explanation thereof will be omitted.
    </p>
    <p num="39">
      In this embodiment, because of the adoption of a construction wherein separate connector pins 33 are inserted into the commutator segments 9, precision in positioning the connector pins 33 can be improved.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, control over the precision of the cross-sectional dimensions of the connector pins 33 is facilitated, enabling the connection to the equalizers 35 to be made more reliable.

      In the equalizer 37 of this embodiment, the connector pins 33 and a plurality of printed circuit boards 36 are integrated in advance.
      <br/>
      Because the mechanically-weak printed circuit boards 36 are preformed into a block by connecting the equalizer 37 to the commutator 6 by means of the connector pins 33 and are bonded to the commutator 6 in such a state, productivity is improved.

    </p>
    <p num="44">
      In this embodiment, the equalizer 38 is disposed between the commutator 6 and the rotor windings 5, but because the outer circumferential dimensions of the equalizer 38 is smaller than the outer diameter of the brush contact surfaces of the commutator 6 and the axial length of the equalizer 38 is short, even if the equalizer 38 and the commutator segments 9 are connected in advance and then the winding operation wherein the rotor windings 5 are mounted by winding wire onto the rotor core 4 is performed, the ease of the winding operation is the same as when the equalizer have not yet been disposed.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, since it is necessary for the distance between the risers 21 and the rotor core 4 to be greater than the length L of the end portion 39 of the rotor windings 5 for the convenience of the automatic winding process, it is normal for a space to arise between the commutator 6 and the end portion 39 of the rotor windings 5.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the equalizer 38 is disposed in this space, eliminating the need to lengthen the electric motor in the axial direction due to installation of the equalizer.

      In this embodiment, because a plurality of equipotential conducting layers 60, 62, 63, 64 having mutually different electric potentials are formed on single substrate, it is no longer necessary to dispose the same number of laminated printed circuit boards as the number of different electric potentials.

      In the example in FIG. 27, four sets of commutator segments 9 having mutually different electric potential can be connected by one printed circuit board 58.

      Thus, the axial length of the electric motor can be reduced, enabling the electric motor to be made more compact.

      In this embodiment, the connector pins 81 pass through the commutator segments 25 in the axial direction, enabling suppression of the commutator segments 25 from jumping out in a radially outward direction due to centrifugal force when the rotor is rotating.

      Moreover, each of the above embodiments has been explained with reference to an electric motor comprising a rotor disposed circumferentially outside and a stator disposed circumferentially inside, but the commutator assembly according to the present invention can also be applied to an electric motor comprising a rotor disposed circumferentially outside and a stator disposed circumferentially inside.

      As explained above, a commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine according to one aspect of the present invention comprises a equalizer being provided with an printed circuit board comprising an insulating substrate and a connecting plate composed of a conducting film formed on the insulating substrate.
      <br/>
      Therefore, the size of the commutator assembly can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Furthermore, because the commutator and the equalizers are separate, the equalizers can be designed to have a suitable current capacity which is smaller than that of the commutator.

      According to one form of the commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine, connecting projections protruding axially may be formed on one end surface of the commutator segments, and the connecting projections may pass through passage bores formed in the connecting plate and may be electrically connected thereto.

      Therefore, positioning of the printed circuit boards, and connection of the connecting plates and the commutator segments can be performed simply, with a reduced number of parts.

      According to another form of the commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine, connecting pins for electrically connecting the connecting plate and the commutator segments extending axially beyond one end surface of the commutator segments may pass through passage bores formed in the connecting plate.

      Therefore, the connecting plates and the commutator segments are connected by connecting pins which are independent of the commutator segments, enabling the machining precision of the connecting pins to be improved and enabling the positioning of the printed circuit boards and the connection of the connecting plates and the commutator segments to be performed simply.

    <p num="67">
      According to still another form of the commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine, the equalizer and the commutator may be integrated by resin.

      According to another form of the commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine, the equalizer may be formed by laminating a plurality of printed circuit boards.

      According to still another form of the commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine, the connecting plate may comprise a plurality of equipotential conducting layers each connecting equipotential commutator segments being formed in one layer.

    <p num="70">
      According to another form of the commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine, the equalizer may be disposed in close proximity to the commutator at the opposite end from the rotor windings and may have outer diameter dimensions smaller than the outer diameter of the commutator.

      Therefore, the necessity to move the brushes radially outwards beyond the radius of the commutator when the rotor is inserted into the stator during the assembly process is removed, improving the production of the motor.

      According to still another form of the commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine, the equalizer may be disposed in close proximity to the commutator at the same end as the rotor windings and may have outer diameter dimensions smaller than the outer diameter of the commutator.

      Therefore, wire can be wound onto the rotor core without obstruction to the winding process of an automatic winding machine, for example, and the axial length of the dynamo-electric machine is shortened.

      According to another form of the commutator assembly for a dynamo-electric machine, the number K of connecting plates relative to a natural number n satisfying the expression (n BETA +(n-1) GAMMA ) &lt;= (360/(2P)- ALPHA ), where P is the number of pairs of poles, Ns is the number of slots formed in said rotor core,  ALPHA  is the brush angle at the contact surface between the brushes and the commutator segments,  BETA  is the commutator angle, and  GAMMA  is the angle between commutator segments, may be given by a whole number satisfying the expression (Ns/(n * P)) &lt;= K &lt;= (Ns/P).
