    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to an electric motor or generator, such as an alternator, having a stator impregnated with a thermally conductive epoxy resin.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Electric motors or generators having a stator secured within the housing of the rotor or generator are well known.
      <br/>
      A rotor coil mounted on a shaft is positioned within the stator and is rotatable relative to the stator about the longitudinal axis of the shaft.
      <br/>
      Liquid cooling can be provided for the motor or generator by passing fluid, such as water, through passages formed in the housing order to provide cooling for the stator.
      <br/>
      In order to enhance the cooling of the stator, the stator can be impregnated with a thermally conductive epoxy resin which promotes the thermal conductivity between the stator and the cooling fluid.
      <br/>
      EP-A-0327338 describes such a known arrangement.
      <br/>
      Because of the tight fitting of the stator in the housing, it can be difficult to impregnate the stator without leaving air pockets in the epoxy resin.
    </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="3">An electric motor or generator in accordance with the present invention comprises a housing having a substantially annular inner surface; a stator having an annular outer surface fixedly secured within the housing against the annular inner surface; a shaft having a longitudinal axis, extending into the housing, and rotatable about the longitudinal axis relative to the housing and the stator; a rotor coil mounted on the shaft and positioned within the stator; and a thermally conductive epoxy resin impregnating the stator; wherein the housing and the annular outer surface of the stator have a number of longitudinally extending slots formed therein within which the epoxy resin is also positioned.</p>
    <p num="4">
      The slots allow easier passage of the epoxy resin around the stator during the impregnating process.
      <br/>
      This reduces the time taken to insert the epoxy resin and improves the quality by reducing the risk of air pockets being left in the (epoxy resin.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="6">
      Referring to the drawings, the embodiment of electric motor or generator in accordance with the present invention is an alternator 10.
      <br/>
      The alternator 10 comprises a housing 12, a stator 14, a shaft 16, and a rotor coil 18.
      <br/>
      The stator 14 is substantially annular and comprises a number of stator laminations 20 with a coil 22 wound around and through the laminations.
      <br/>
      The housing 12 has annular inner surface 24 against which the annular outer surface 25 of the stator 14 makes a tight fit.
      <br/>
      Passages 26 are formed in the housing 12 for the passage of a cooling fluid through the housing.
      <br/>
      The stator 14 is impregnates with a thermally conductive epoxy resin 28 after the stator has been positioned in the housing 12, with the epoxy resin substantially filling every gap between the stator coil 22, the laminations 20, and the housing 12.
      <br/>
      The epoxy resin 28 enhances the thermal conductivity between the stator 14 and the cooling fluid in the passages 26 in the housing 12.
      <br/>
      The rotor coil 18 is mounted on the shaft 16 and positioned inside the stator 14.
      <br/>
      The shaft 16 has a longitudinal axis A and is rotatable about its axis relative to the housing 12 and the stator 14.
      <br/>
      The alternator 10 as thus far described is well known and other features of the alternator which are well known to those skilled in the art will not be described in further detail.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      In order to provide quicker insertion of the epoxy resin 28 during the embedding process, and in order to reduce the likelihood of air pockets being formed in the epoxy resin, a number of longitudinally extending slots 30 are formed in the annular inner surface 24 of the housing 12, and a corresponding number of longitudinally extending slots 31 are formed in the annular outer surface 25 of the stator 14.
      <br/>
      During assembly of the alternator 10, the stator 14 is pushed into the housing 12 and the annular outer surface 25 makes a tight sliding fit against the annular inner surface 24 of the housing, with the slots 30,31 therein being substantially aligned.
      <br/>
      Epoxy resin 28 is then introduced around the stator 14 by any suitable process, for example, by injection or gravity feeding, for example, through one or more radially extending apertures 32 in the housing 12, and allowed to harden.
      <br/>
      As an alternative, the aperture(s) in the housing 12 may extend radially.
      <br/>
      At least one additional aperture (not shown) may also be provided in the housing 12 to allow the escape of air during the filling process.
      <br/>
      The slots 30 in the annular inner surface 44 of the housing 12 and the slots 31 in the annular outer surface 25 of the stator 14 allow the epoxy resin 28 to more easily flow around the coil 22 of the stator 14 and into the gaps 33 between the coil 22 and the laminations 20, when compared to a housing having no such slots.
      <br/>
      This provides for quicker insertion of the epoxy resin 28, reduced risk of air pocket formation, and reduced risk of separation of the components (such as the filler) of the epoxy resin.
      <br/>
      As a further advantage, the keying of the stator 14 to the housing 12 by way of the epoxy resin 28 in the slots 30 reduces the risk of unintended stator rotation relative to the housing.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In an alternative to the above described arrangement, the slots 30 in the annular inner surface 24 of the housing 12, or the slots 31 in the annular outer surface 25 of the stator 14, may be omitted.</p>
    <p num="9">The housing 12 is preferably cast in one piece using the lost foam or sand cast process.</p>
