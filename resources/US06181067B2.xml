    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to a portable lighting product, a portable lighting product circuit and a method of operating a portable lighting product circuit, and more particularly to portable lighting products including flashlights and bicycle lights, camping lights and other portable lighting products.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In many applications of portable lighting products, users are ultimately concerned with such factors as bulk of product and the running life of that product.
      <br/>
      For example for flashlights with 6 or 8 dry cells in series, these may need to be replenished or replaced either at the start of a shift or during a shift and the human condition will dictate that it will be at the worst possible time.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Generally with 6 and 8 dry cell flashlights, the dry cells are connected in series in a straight line making the bodies of the flashlights relatively long.
      <br/>
      This can render such flashlights as menacing to the general public because of a club like appearance.
      <br/>
      Also their relatively long length renders them difficult to store in cupboards and vehicles, or when carried on belts they can interfere with the wearer's movement.
      <br/>
      Such flashlights can at times be any thing up to 1 meter or 39 inches long.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Also, in today's market, brighter operating lamps are being developed, but at the relatively high voltages of 9 or 12 volts, the filaments of such lamps are relatively fragile.
      <br/>
      Such fragility can b directly proportional to the voltage at which the lamp is operated.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Whilst a solution to the first and second mentioned difficulties can be to provide the power supply from sets of dry cells in parallel, this solution results in an additional problem.
      <br/>
      When sets of series connected dry cells are connected in parallel, there are risks of dissipation and transfer of energy from one set of dry cells to another, when they are not powering a lamp.
      <br/>
      This can lead to premature dissipation of the available energy in the dry cells.
      <br/>
      Potential risks of premature dissipation is one reason why manufacturers have not utilised parallel dry cell arrangements for dry cell powered products.
    </p>

    <p num="51">When this advance is coupled with the advances in lamps and their ability to luminesce to a greater degree at lower voltages, and the fact that such lamps are more susceptible to damage when operated at higher voltages, a longer life of lamp may result together with a relatively unnoticeable reduction in the luminescence of the lamp.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="53">
      Illustrated in FIG. 1 is a portable lighting product circuit 2.
      <br/>
      In the portable lighting product circuit 2 is a lamp 4A in a lamp holder 4 which includes a ground terminal or body 6 which makes contact with a ground terminal of a lamp 4A.
      <br/>
      The lamp 4A held by the lamp holder 4 can be of any sort but is preferably of the halogen or krypton type which operate at 3.6 volts or 4.7 volts.
      <br/>
      The ground terminal 6 is electrically connected by an electrical connection means 7 (which can be a wire or other electrical connection means such as a printed circuit board track, a case connection or a combination of such electrical connection means.
      <br/>
      These will be hereinafter referred to as "electrical connection means") to the negative ends 16 and 18 of two power sources 20 and 22 each made up of a set of three series connected dry cells 24.
      <br/>
      Each of the three series connected dry cells 24 in each power source 20 and 22 are all the same size, generally of the AA, AAA, C, D size and are approximately of 1 to 1.5 volts of electrical potential.
      <br/>
      Alternatively the dry cells could each be of the lantern type or rectangular 9 volt type These are connected positive end to negative end in a series connection as is commonly known in the art, in each of the power sources 20 and 22.
    </p>
    <p num="54">A second terminal 8 of lamp holder 4 is electrically connected by an electrical connection means 10 to two parallel connected poles, the first being pole 12 and the second being pole 14, An electrical connection means 26 connects the positive end 28 of the first power source 20 to pole 34 whilst an electrical connection means 30 connects the positive end 32 of the power source 22 to pole 36.</p>
    <p num="55">
      The circuit between the pole 34 and pole 14 can be closed by means of switching mechanism 38.
      <br/>
      Whereas the circuit between the pole 36 and the pole 12 can be closed by the switching mechanism 40.
      <br/>
      The switching mechanisms 38 and 40 are combined into a single switch 42 which is a double pole, double throw switch.
      <br/>
      Preferably the switch 42 is of small proportions, such as one having a length and width of approximatley 10 mm.
      <br/>
      The double pole, double throw switch is utilised so that a single action of the operator moving the switch to a first condition will electrically isolate each power source 20 and 22 when the lamp 4A in the lamp holder 4 is not emitting light (ie the portable lighting product in which the circuit is installed is switched off).
      <br/>
      The double pole double throw switch 42 when moved to a second condition puts both power sources 20 and 22 in parallel connection with the lamp holder 4.
    </p>
    <p num="56">
      In an alternative embodiment, the portable lighting product circuit 2 can be modified by the switch 42 being substituted by a switching mechanism that operates each switching mechanism 38 and 40 individually or alternately by the operators action.
      <br/>
      In particular the switches 38 and 40 could be individual switches and individually opened or closed.
      <br/>
      In this case the operator will know that either or both or none of the power sources 20 or 22 are connected in the circuit because the lamp 4A in the lamp holder 4 will be emitting light, albeit at low wattage if only one is connected.
    </p>
    <p num="57">
      In a still further embodiment, the portable lighting product circuit 2 of FIG. 1 can be modified by the addition of a single pole, single throw switch in the electrical connection means 26 and 30.
      <br/>
      These additional switches can be the same as switches 64 and 66 of FIGS. 23 and 24. In this embodiment an operator can select either one or both of the power sources 20 or 22 by closing one or both of the single pole single throw switches respectively.
      <br/>
      This will identify or set which power source (20 or 22 or both) will supply current to the lamp holder 4 when the switch mechanisms 40 and 38 are closed in the switch 42.
    </p>
    <p num="58">The principles and modifications and features discussed in the previous two paragraphs can also be applied to the circuits of FIGS. 23 to 27 inclusive.</p>
    <p num="59">
      As illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3 or 4 the switching mechanism 42 has six terminals and is used as a double pole double throw switch.
      <br/>
      However, for the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 and FIGS. 5 to 10, the poles 1 and 3 as illustrated in FIG. 4 are not connected into the circuit.
      <br/>
      The poles 12 and 14 are common and connected to a common terminal 8 by electrical connection means 10 whereas poles 36 and 34 are the terminations of electrical connection means 26 and 30.
    </p>
    <p num="60">In the end view of FIG. 2 the switch 42 is in the off condition, whereas the switch 42 in the side view of FIG. 3 is switched to the on condition, which is done by the depression of the button 41 in the downward direction of arrows 43.</p>
    <p num="61">
      When the switch 42 is in a condition at which the portable lighting product circuit 2 is switched "off", the poles 1 &amp; 12 and 3 &amp; 14 are closed (or electrically connected) whereas poles 12 &amp; 36 and 14 &amp; 34 are open (or not electrically connected).
      <br/>
      Whereas when the portable lighting product circuit 2 is in the "on" condition, poles 1 &amp; 12 and 3 &amp; 14 are open (or not electrically connected) and poles 12 &amp; 36 and 14 &amp; 34 are closed (or electrically connected).
    </p>
    <p num="62">The portable lighting product circuit 2 illustrated in FIG. 1 can be installed in the flashlight 49 of FIGS. 5 to 10.</p>
    <p num="63">
      In the flashlight 49 illustrated in FIGS. 5 to 10, each power source 20 and 22 is physically isolated from each other inside power source housings 50 and 52 respectively.
      <br/>
      Each power source housing 50 and 52 is closed by a sealed and screwed on end cap 51.
      <br/>
      The portable lighting product circuit 2 of FIG. 1 can be installed in any appropriate location inside the body of flashlight 49.
      <br/>
      As can be seen from FIGS. 7 and 8, the switch 42 is located in the vicinity of the terminus of the power source housings 50 and 52.
      <br/>
      Some other components of the portable lighting product circuit 2 can be located in the region between the termini of the power source housings 50 and 52 and the lamp end 41.
    </p>
    <p num="64">
      Illustrated in FIGS. 11 to 16 is an embodiment similar to that of FIGS. 5 to 10, wherein three power source housings 50, 52 and 160 are provided.
      <br/>
      With this embodiment, the portable lighting product circuit 2A of FIG. 23 can be utilised.
    </p>
    <p num="65">In FIGS. 11 to 16 like features with FIGS. 5 to 10 have been like numbered and the same is the case with FIGS. 1 and 23.</p>
    <p num="66">
      The power source housing 160 (see FIG. 11) houses power source 60 (see FIG. 23) including three series connected dry cells 24 (see FIG. 23).
      <br/>
      In FIG. 23 there is positioned in the circuit 2A a three pole switch 62 which activates switch mechanisms 38, 40 as in FIG. 1, but as well, an additional switch mechanism 73 which when closed electrically connects poles 72 and 74.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      In the electrical connection means 26, 30 and 68, from the positive ends of the power sources 20, 22 and 60 and the respective poles 34, 36 and 72, are located single pole single throw switches 64, 66 and 70.
      <br/>
      These switches allow an operator to select either one of power sources 20, 22 and 60, or groups of them such as any two or all three of them, to be connected in parallel with the lamp holder 4, when the three pole switch 62 is activated, by closing switch mechanisms 73, 40 and 38 which will close the circuits between poles 74 &amp; 72, 12 &amp; 36 and 14 &amp; 34. 17 to 22 illustrate a four power source housing flashlight similar to FIGS. 11 to 16 and like parts have been like numbered.
      <br/>
      FIG. 24 is an illustration of a circuit 2B embodying the invention for use with the flashlight of FIGS. 17 to 22. Like parts of FIG. 24 have been like numbered with like parts of FIG. 23.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      In FIGS. 17 to 22 a fourth power source housing 180 is incorporated in the flashlight of these figures.
      <br/>
      The additional or fourth power source housing 180 houses power source 80 (of FIG. 24) and includes a set of three series connected dry cells 24 as illustrated in FIG. 24. The circuit 2B in FIG. 24 differs from the circuit 2A of FIG. 23 by the addition of: the power source 80 of three series connected dry cells; electrical connection means 82 from the positive end of the power source 80 to pole 86; parallel pole 90 on the lamp holder 4 side of the circuit 2B; switch mechanism 84 which serves the same function as switch mechanisms 64, 66 and 70 for the power source 80; and the substitution of the 3 pole switch 62 by a 4 pole switch 88, and a parallel connection to the other negative ends of the power sources 20, 22 and 60.
    </p>
    <p num="69">
      The circuit 2B of FIG. 24 functions in a similar manner to that of FIG. 23, in that the operator can select any one power source, group of two power sources, group of three power sources or all four power sources 20, 22, 60 and 80.
      <br/>
      However with an even number power sources 20, 2260 and 80, double pole double throw switches similar to 42 can be connected into electrical connection means 26 &amp; 30, and 68 &amp; 82, so as to select two power sources such as 20 &amp; 22 or 60 &amp; 80 at a time.
    </p>
    <p num="70">If desired a single power source housing can be utilised to house all the power sources in such a way that the individual cells of each set are connected in series and in accordance with circuits of FIGS. 1, 23 or 24.</p>
    <p num="71">
      If the number of power sources is required to exceed that illustrated in FIGS. 1, 23 or 24, then the switching mechanisms will need to be commensurately altered and further electrical connection means added and if required single pole single throw switches for the selection of the power source or power sources.
      <br/>
      The proviso being that when the portable lighting product is switched off, the switch mechanisms electrically isolate all power sources with respect to each other.
    </p>
    <p num="72">
      Whilst in the above descriptions of the embodiments the switches and switching mechanisms are located on the positive side of the power source in the circuit, the switches and switching mechanisms could be located on the negative side as well.
      <br/>
      If there is more than one type of switch as in FIGS. 23 and 24, they may be on either the positive and negative sides of the circuit or on both sides of the circuit, or on the positive side of a first power source, the negative side of an adjacent power source and so on.
    </p>
    <p num="73">Preferably, the dry cells 24 are first installed in series connection into a cartridge mechanism to hold the sets of serially connected dry cells together to thereby form the power sources 20, 2260 or 80, where upon they can then be placed inside the power source housings 50, 52160 or 180 and the housings sealed by end caps 51 making the necessary connections into the open circuit or closed circuit if the appropriate switches are closed.</p>
    <p num="74">It may be desired to also associate with each set of series connected dry cells or power source, by providing appropriate circuitry, a battery life indicator so that an operator will be aware of the status of each power source 20, 22, 60 or 80.</p>
    <p num="75">
      The life of a dry cell is impacted by the rate at which current is drawn from the dry cell.
      <br/>
      When all of the dry cells in a portable lighting product are connected in series they are exposed to the same drain rate when a portable lighting product is switched on.
      <br/>
      However, if the exact same dry cells are connected in two equal numbered groups of series connected sets which are then connected in parallel, the drain rate per cell may be reduced somewhere in the range of 35% to 60% by comparison to the same number of cells all connected together by series connections.
      <br/>
      This reduction in drain rate allows the dry cells to discharge more efficiently and can thus improve the life or run time of the portable lighting product or other apparatus.
    </p>
    <p num="76">
      Illustrated in FIGS. 25, 26 and 27 are circuits 2C, 2D and 2E respectively.
      <br/>
      In these circuits the power sources 20, 22, 60 and 80, are each illustrated as being comprised of only one dry cell 24.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, the power sources 20, 22, 60 and 80 could be comprised of two or more series connected dry cells.
      <br/>
      It is envisaged that sets of series connected dry cells can be pre packaged, and would be sold for installation in equipment which incorporates any of the above described circuits.
      <br/>
      Alternatively, cartridges holding a predetermined number of appropriately sized dry cells could receive individual cells and which can then be installed in the portable lighting product.
      <br/>
      The circuits 2C, 2D, and 2E of FIGS. 25, 26 and 27 respectively, operate in the same manner as those of FIGS. 1, 23 and 24.
    </p>
    <p num="77">Whilst the above description refers to flashlights and portable lighting products generally, it will be understood that the inventions described are applicable to any dry cell powered portable lighting devices such as: torches, flashlights, lanterns, desk lamps, area lights, combination area flashlights, front bicycle lights, rear bicycle lights, emergency lights, night lights, and rechargeable versions of any of those products previously mentioned.</p>
    <p num="78">Whilst the above portable lighting products may be supplied with dry cells and power sources in the housings and chambers, they could be typically sold without said power sources and dry cells.</p>
