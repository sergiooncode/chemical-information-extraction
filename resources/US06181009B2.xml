    <p num="5">FIG. 39 is a perspective view showing a state in which electrodes 2 attached onto a surface of a semiconductor chip 1 according to a conventional ultrasonic thermocompression wire bonding method are connected through gold lines 5 to inner leads 4 extending from lead frames, not shown, and FIG. 40 is a diagrammatic illustration of a state in which one end of the gold line is being connected to the electrode 2 on the semiconductor chip 1 by the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding.</p>
    <p num="6">
      In FIG. 40, the semiconductor chip 1 is fixedly secured through a die bonding material 6 onto a die pad 41.
      <br/>
      The die bonding material 6 and the die pad 41 can withstand the pressing force from a capillary 7 needed to from a ball 51 at the tip portion of the gold line 5 into a ball bonding configuration 52 when being connected to the electrode 2 by the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding, and further support the semiconductor chip 1.
      <br/>
      In the ultrasonic thermocompression wire bonding method, the tip portion of the gold line 5 passing through the capillary 7 is turned into the ball 51 configuration by means of a high-voltage discharge.
      <br/>
      Subsequently, the ball 51 is pressed against the electrode 2 on the semiconductor chip 1 and subjected to ultrasonic vibration and heat, whereby it is ultrasonic thermocompression-bonded to the electrode 2 as indicated at 52 in the same illustration.
      <br/>
      Further, the capillary 7 is moved to the position of the tip portion of the inner lead 4 before being lowered to couple the tip portion of the inner lead 4 to the gold line 5.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      FIGS. 41A, 41B and 42 are illustrations of a structure of a lead frame in a state where the electrodes 2 are coupled through the gold lines 5 to the tip portions of the inner leads 4 in accordance with a conventional ultrasonic thermocompression wire bonding method.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 41A, a frame 3 is formed integrally with 8 die pads 41, not shown, and 36 inner leads 4, not shown.
      <br/>
      FIG. 41B is an enlarged view showing a portion indicated by X in FIG. 41A. In FIG. 41B, the frame 3 has 36 inner leads 4 at its inside portion, a die pad 41 supported by the frame 3 through suspended leads 42 at its central portion, and external leads 44 at its circumferential portion.
      <br/>
      FIG. 42 is an illustration of the detailed structure of the 36 inner leads 4, die pad 41 and suspended leads 42.

      In the same illustration, a rectangle indicated by a broken line is representative of a position that is packed with a molding resin.

      FIG. 43 is a cross-sectional view showing a semiconductor device completed such that the electrode 2 is connected through the gold line 5 to the inner lead 4 in accordance with the foregoing ultrasonic thermocompression wire bonding method before the frame 3 is packed with a molding resin 8.

      In the same illustration, reference numeral 53 designates a contact portion between the inner lead 4 and the gold line 5 due to the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding.
      <br/>
      FIG. 44 is an enlarged view showing a pressure-bonded portion between an electrode, not shown, and the inner lead 4 on the chip 1, and FIG. 45 is an illustration of the deformation of the ball 51 when the ball 51 is ultrasonic thermocompression-bonded onto the electrode 2 on a surface of the semiconductor chip 1.
      <br/>
      In the same illustration, when the electrode 2 is an aluminium electrode, the gold line 5 and the ball-deformed portion 52 both consist of the same gold line material at the time of the completion of the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding, while an alloy layer of gold and aluminium is formed as a pressure-bonded layer 54 with the aluminium electrode.
      <br/>
      Reference numeral 21 depicts an electrically insulating passivation film (which will be referred hereinafter to as an electrically insulating film) attached onto the semiconductor chip 1 at a position other than the electrode 2.
    </p>
    <p num="8">
      FIG. 46 illustrates a state in which the ball-deformed portion 52 of the gold line 5 is pressed against the electrode 2 by means of the capillary 7 with the completed connection.

      FIG. 47 shows a state in which the other end portion of the gold line 5 is stitch-bonded to the inner lead 4 by the capillary 7 and its deformed portion 53 is pressed against the tip portion of the inner lead 4.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 47, although the material of the deformed portion 53 stitch-bonded to the inner lead 4 depends upon the lead frame material, when an iron frame is used, a silver plating is made, and hence an alloy layer made of gold and silver is produced in the stitch side.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the alloy layer 54 made of gold is present as shown in FIG. 45, but has been omitted in FIG. 47.

      FIGS. 48A to 48E are illustrations for describing processes taken for when the inner lead 4 is connected through the gold line 5 to an electrode on the semiconductor chip 1 according to the conventional ultrasonic thermocompression wire bonding technique.

      In FIG. 18A, heat is transferred from a heating block 9 through the die pad 41 to the chip 1 by heat conduction.
      <br/>
      The tip portion of the gold line 5 leading from the tip portion of the capillary 7 is formed into a ball configuration by a high voltage power supply torch 10 to have a ball configuration.

      FIG. 48B shows a state in which the capillary 7 is lowered toward the electrode 2 (omitted from the illustration) so that formed ball 51 is pressure-bonded to the electrode under the ultrasonic vibration and pressure force.
      <br/>
      FIG. 48C illustrates a state in which the capillary 7 through which the gold line 5 passes is moved toward the inner lead 4 in order for the other end of the gold line 5 to be connected to the inner lead 4 after the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding of the ball 51 is completed as shown in FIG. 45. FIG. 48D is illustrative of a state where the other end of the gold line 5 is stitch-bonded to the inner lead 4, and FIG. 48E is illustrative of a state in which the other end of the gold line 5 is pressure-attached to the inner lead 4 by the stitch bonding in the state as shown in FIG. 47 before the gold line 5 is held and lifted by a clamp 11 of the capillary 7 to be cut off at the stitch bonded portion.

      FIG. 49 is a top plan view of a semiconductor chip 1 produced such that the electrode 2 and the inner lead 4 are coupled through the gold line 5 to each other by means of the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding, and FIG. 50 illustrates 19 electrodes 2 on the semiconductor chip 1, wherein reference numeral 2i designates an electrically insulating film attached to a portion other than the electrodes 2 on the semiconductor chip 1.
      <br/>
      The electrode 2 has a dimension of C * E and the electrically insulating film 2i has a dimension of B * D larger than the dimension of the electrode 2, and hence the boundary between the electrode 2 and the electrically insulating film 2i appears so that the electrode 2 is exposed as shown in FIG. 51. The cross-sectional structure of the semiconductor chip 1 is made such that the electrically insulating film 2i overlaps with the circumferential portion of the electrode 2 as shown in FIG. 45. As illustrated in FIG. 51, in order to increase the electrical and mechanical degree of coupling of the gold line 5, the area of the electrode 2 should be greater than the circumferential area of the ball-deformed portion 52 when the ball 51 is ultrasonic thermocompression-bonded.

    <p num="11">
      Depended upon the accuracy of the wire bonding apparatus.
      <br/>
      The dimension A between the electrodes 2 as shown in FIG. 51 should be determined taking the circumferential dimension of the ball deformed portion 52 and others into consideration.
      <br/>
      In general, as long as the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding is made, the width of the electrode 2 to be wire-bonded should be larger than the width of the circuit wiring 21 in FIG. 51. Further, in the case of the conventional wire bonding method, the semiconductor device should be designed on the basis of dimensions I, J, K and L as shown in FIG. 52 while taking into account accuracy and performance of the wire bonding.

      Whether or not the dimension of the gold line 5 relative to the corner portion of the semiconductor chip 1 is satisfactory can be known by checking the dimension I. The space between the corner portion of the die pad 41 and the gold wire 5 can be confirmed on the basis of the dimension J and the relationship between the die pad 41 and the inner lead 4.

      FIG. 56 is an illustration for describing one example of a method of anode-junctioning a semiconductor material (member) made of silicon with an electrically insulating material (member), as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 53-28747. In FIG. 56, a semiconductor material 1a is placed on a resistance heating strip 67 to be energized and heated by a power supply A. Onto a surface of the semiconductor material 1a there is attached a glass film 1b being an insulating coat (for example, boro-silicate glass made of boric acid and silicic acid) which shows slightly electrical conductivity property when being heated.
      <br/>
      Further, numeral 68 designates an electrically insulating material which is layered up and joined on and with the semiconductor material 1a with the insulating coat (film) 1b being interposed therebetween, and numeral 65 denotes a pressure connecting piece for lightly pressing the electrically insulating material 68 against the semiconductor material 1a.
      <br/>
      Further a positive electrode terminal 63 of a direct-current power supply 60 is connected to the resistance heating strip 67 for causing the positive current to flow from the semiconductor material 1a to the electrically insulating material 68, while the negative electrode terminal thereof is connected with the pressure connecting piece 65.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      Next, a description will be made in terms of the anode junction method.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor material 1a is heated through the resistance heating strip 67 to the extent that the insulating coat 1b has slight electrical conductive characteristics (to approximately 400 to 700 degrees, depending upon the insulating coat material).
      <br/>
      As a result, a small positive current (for example, several  MU A/mm2) flows for about one minute from the semiconductor material 1a to the electrically insulating material 68, whereby an anode growth oxide junction takes place in the boundary between the semiconductor material 1a and the electrically insulating material 68, thus completing the anode junction between the semiconductor material 1a and the electrically insulating material 68.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      At this time, the electrically insulating material 68 is melted by neither the heating temperature nor the applied current.
      <br/>
      The heating is only for giving the conductive property to the insulating coat 1b.
      <br/>
      The junction between the semiconductor material 1a and the electrically insulating material 68 can be achieved only with the positive current flowing from the semiconductor material 1a to the electrically insulating material 68.

    <p num="17">
      FIG. 57 is an illustration for describing one example of a method of anode-junctioning two semiconductor materials 1c, 1d made of silicon with an electrically insulating material 68, as disclosed again Japanese Patent Publication No. 53-28747. In this method, the two semiconductor materials 1c and 1d whose function surfaces are attached onto the insulating coat 1b are placed on the electrically insulating material 68 which in turn, is mounted on the resistance heating strip 67.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor materials 1c and 1d are respectively equipped with direct-current power supplies 61, 62 for causing positive currents to flow, and the positive electrode terminals of the direct-current power supplies 61, 62 are connected to the corresponding semiconductor materials 1c, 1d, respectively, while the negative electrode terminals thereof are in common to the resistance heating strip 67.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      Furthermore, in the anode junction method, the resistance heating strip 67 will heat the semiconductor materials 1c, 1d through the electrically insulating material 68 so that the insulating coat 1b has a slight electrical conductive property.
      <br/>
      As a result a small positive current (for example, several  MU A/mm2) flows for about one minute from the semiconductor materials 1c, 1d to the electrically insulating material 68, whereby an anode growth oxide junction takes place in the boundary between the semiconductor materials 1c, 1d and the electrically insulating material 68, thus completing the anode junction between the semiconductor materials 1c, 1d and the electrically insulating material 68.

      As examples of general application of the anode electrode junction method disclosed in other publications, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 1-185242 and 4-146841 disclose a method wherein the silicon surface of the rear surface of a silicon wafer is used as an electrically conductive surface which in turn, is junctioned with a surface of a glass wafer.
      <br/>
      Japanese Patent Publication No. 53-28747 exemplifies, as a semiconductor, a junction between silicon and quartz, a junction between silicon and boro-silicate glass made of boric acid and silicic acid which is a heat resistance glass having a low expansion coefficient, a junction between a germanium semiconductor and a boro-silicate glass, and a junction between silicon and sapphire.

      A detailed description of the principle of the anode junction method will be omitted here as it is made in the Japanese Patent Publication No. 53-28747 and others.

      FIG. 58 is a plan view showing a conventional laminated multi-layer insulating substrate, and FIG. 59 is a cross-sectional perspective view showing the longitudinal structure of FIG. 58. In FIG. 58, numeral 70 designates a laminated multi-layer insulating substrate, numeral 71 depicts an insulating plate, and 76 stands for wiring patterned on the insulating plate 71.
      <br/>
      Further, in FIG. 59, numerals 71 to 75 indicate five insulating plates stacked up, and numerals 76 to 81 and the black-colored portions represent wiring patterned on the insulating plates 71 to 75, respectively.
      <br/>
      For formation of the laminated multi-layer insulating substrate 70 by stacking up the insulating plates 71 to 75 on top of each other, lead wires are inserted into throughholes formed in the insulating plates 71 to 75 and electrically coupled to the wiring of the insulating plates 71 to 74 stacked on each other.
    </p>
    <p num="22">The joining method of the conventional technology were described above in the following order: the wire bonding method, the bump junction method by the TAB and anode junction method which have been known as prior junction techniques, while the anode junction method has been known as means to coat the chip surface with an insulating film as well as to junction a silicon making up a strain gage with a base used for the stress relaxation in a pressure sensor.</p>
    <p num="23">In a conventional anode junction method generally used, the silicon itself to be junctioned with a glass insulating plate has some degree of rigidity and for the junction a glass insulating plate is used which also has the some degree of rigidity as the silicon has.</p>
    <p num="24">
      In the above description, the wire bonding method must include 1) the formation of the ball, 2) the heating, application of pressing force, and supply of ultrasonic vibration in the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding, 3) the movement of the capillary, 4) the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding for the stitch portion, and 5) practicing the five processes for cutting the gold line even for one inner lead.
      <br/>
      Even in the bump junction by TAB 1) the heating compression bonding, and 2) the moving process repeated by the number of the electrode junctions must be carved out.
      <br/>
      The collective bonding is still not put into practice.
      <br/>
      In these junction methods, the electrode and the electrode to be electrically connected to each other, i.e., a metallic conductor and a metallic conductor are made to be joined with each other by the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding or thermocompression bonding.
      <br/>
      For this reason, the mechanical strength of the junction portions to be electrically connected to each other, for example, the shear strength, depends upon the state of the junctioned portions.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      In addition, the portions that are ultrasonic thermocompression-bonded or thermocompression-bonded constitute an alloy layer due to being organizationally broken and rejoined by the metal contact frictional heating and the applied load, constitute an alloy layer.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a safe strength can not be ensured except where area of the junction is large.
      <br/>
      For instance, when the diameter of the gold line is  PHI =25  MU m, the diameter  PHI  of the contact surface of the junctioned portion is set to be  PHI =100  MU m. That is, the diameter becomes four times and the area becomes sixteen times that of the gold line.
    </p>
    <p num="26">The following problems arise with the conventional contact methods for the electrode and the inner lead.</p>
    <p num="27">
      a) In the case of the conventional method in which the connection between the electrode and the inner lead is made through a gold line having an extremely low rigidity, it is necessary to provide mechanical strength to both end portions of the gold line to be electrically connected, so that the dimension of the connected portion needs to exceed the value necessary for the electrical connection.
      <br/>
      As a result, the dimensions of the electrodes on the chip must which goes be large against the object of increasing the degree of the density of integrated circuits (IC).
      <br/>
      This became a to miniaturizing IC chips.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      b) In the case of the prior method wherein the junction between the inner lead and the electrode is made through a member such as the gold line having an extremely low rigidity, it is necessary that the semiconductor chip and the inner lead are molded in order to protect both the end portions of the gold line to be electrically coupled and the gold line itself against the external loads or to protect the semiconductor chip itself against the external environment.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, increasing the outer dimensions of the semiconductor device to a given value is unavoidable.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      c) Because of the recent high integration of ICs, number of electrodes for taking signals to the exterior is increasing.
      <br/>
      However, in the conventional wire bonding method or bump junction method by TAB, in order to ensure the mechanical junctioning strength to some extend, the dimension of the electrode needs to be increased up to a predetermined dimension, with the result that the dimension of the entire chip depends upon the number of electrodes, thus becoming a barrier to miniaturizing IC chips.
    </p>
    <p num="30">d) In cases where the number of connection pins formed by extending the inner leads up to the outside of the sealing section is above 100, even if the connection accuracy varies because of the wire bonding method in which the joining work is carried out for each of the electrodes, difficulty is experienced in checking whether or not the contacts with the electrodes are normal.</p>
    <p num="31">
      e) Since it is difficult to known the accurate value of the mechanical strength of the alloy layer made at the junctioned portion through the ultrasonic thermocompression bonding or the thermocompression bonding, it is necessary to design the junctioned portion with a high safety factor.
      <br/>
      For this reason, a sufficient over-design is required taking into account vibration during the assembly process, empty weight and other external forces into consideration, and hence a limitation on designing occurs.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      f) In a conventional electrode connecting method, the connecting work needs to be repeatedly done the some number of times as the number n of the electrodes or twice the number n of electrodes (2n).
      <br/>
      For this reason, as the number of the pins in the semiconductor device increases, the time required for the connections increases.

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="59">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="60">
      A description will be made hereinbelow in terms of an embodiment of this invention.
      <br/>
      FIG. 1 is a side elevational and cross-sectional view of an anode junctioning means and semiconductor chip for describing a method of anode-junctioning an inner lead with each electrode of a semiconductor chip, where parts corresponding to those in FIG. 56 are marked with the same reference numerals.
      <br/>
      In the illustration, numeral 1 represents a semiconductor chip, and numeral 2a designates an insulating coat made of a glass material and adhered onto portion of a surface of the semiconductor chip 1 other than the electrode portions by means of a sputtering method, the insulating coat showing a conductive property when being subjected to heating.
      <br/>
      It is preferable that a boro-silicate glass (generally used for a flasks, etc) made of boric acid and silicic acid is used as the glass material.
      <br/>
      One reason is that, since the coefficient of linear expansion of the boro-silicate glass is substantially equal to the coefficient of linear expansion of the electrical insulating film made of a silicon oxide and provided on the semiconductor chip 1, it is difficult for the glass material to peel off from the electrical insulating film even when the insulating film cools off.
      <br/>
      Further, numeral 3 denotes a lead frame having a configuration as shown in FIG. 42. In the case of the lead frame 3 in this embodiment, a die pad 41 and suspended leads 42 (indicated by broken lines) which have been needed for mounting the semiconductor chip become unnecessary, because the inner leads 4 are directly anode-junctioned with the semiconductor chip 1.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 1, the semiconductor chip 1 is positioned at the central portion of the area in which the conventional die pad 41 is provided.
      <br/>
      In addition, each inner lead 4 is made to extend up above each electrode of the semiconductor chip 1 as shown in FIG. 3.
    </p>
    <p num="61">
      Furthermore, in FIG. 3, the positions of the tip portions of the conventional inner leads 4 are indicated by respective broken lines, and inner leads 4a in this embodiment as the portions extending from the broken lines position.
      <br/>
      The tip portion of each of the inner leads 4a extends so as to cross over an electrode 2 formed on the top surface of the semiconductor chip 1.
      <br/>
      In the same illustration, the tip portion of each of the inner leads 4a, painted out in black, is anode-junctioned with the insulating coat 2a on the semiconductor chip 1, while the electrode 2 is pressed by the rear surface of the inner lead 4a to make an electrical connection therebetween.
      <br/>
      That is, when the inner lead 4a is joined with the insulating coat 2a, the joining surface of the inner lead 4a is pressed against the surface of the electrode 2 protruding several microns from the insulating coat 2a thus making the electrical connection.
    </p>
    <p num="62">
      With the above-mentioned structure, when a current due to a power supply A flows through power leads 66a, 66b into a resistance heating plate 67, the resistance heating plate 67 generates heat to heat, through the lead frame 3, the insulating coat 2a up to approximately 400 (degree)  C. +- 50 (degree)  C., whereby result in a conductive property the insulating coat 2a.
      <br/>
      When a direct-current voltage is applied between the lead frame 3 and a positioning jig 68a while conductively tied together from a direct-current power supply 60, a positive current flows between the insulating coat 2a and the lead frame 3.
      <br/>
      As a result, an electrostatic adhesive strength and electrochemical bonding strength take place at the boundary plane 2a1 (indicated by a thick line under the insulating coat 2a) between the insulating coat 2a and the lead frame 3 so that the inner leads at the tip portion of the lead frame 3 are anode-junctioned with the semiconductor chip surface.

      For the electrical connection between the inner leads 3 and the electrodes 2 of the semiconductor chip 1, as shown in FIG. 3, the tip portion of the inner lead 4a, painted out in black, is anode-junctioned with the insulating coat 2a on the semiconductor chip 1, while the electrode 2 is pressed by the rear surface of the inner lead 4a to make the electrical connection therebetween.
      <br/>
      That is, when the inner lead 4a is joined with the insulating coat 2a, the joining surface of the inner lead 4a is pressed against the surface of the electrode 2 protruding several microns from the insulating coat 2a, thus making the electrical connection.

      FIG. 2 is an illustration for describing a method of simultaneously anode-junctioning a plurality of semiconductor chips 1 with a lead frame 3.
      <br/>
      In the illustration, numeral 61 represents a direct-current power supply for causing a positive current to flow into the insulating coat 2a of one semiconductor chip 1 and the lead frame 3, and numeral 62 designates a direct-current power supply for causing a positive current to flow into the insulating coat 2a of the other semiconductor chip 1 and the lead frame 3.
      <br/>
      In the illustration, the two semiconductor chips 1d, 1c are placed on the lead frame 3 and simultaneously anode-junctioned therewith, and using the two direct-current power supplies 61, 62, positive currents are designed to flow between the semiconductor chips 1d, 1c and the lead frame 3.
      <br/>
      In this case, if the semiconductor chips 1c, 1d can accurately be positioned relative to the lead frame 3 by some means, there is no need for a positioning jig 68a to be used as a pressing jig, positioning jig and common short-circuit conductive piece as shown in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      In the case of this method, it is possible to merely give a positive current in a state in which the insulating coat 2a side is treated as a cathode and the lead frame 3 being a metallic conductor is treated as an anode.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is also appropriate that a positive potential be applied from direct-current power supplies so that a single or a plurality of collets (vacuum adsorbers), not shown, for adsorbing the lead frame 3 can become an anode.
      <br/>
      In this case, using a single direct-current power supply is possible.

      FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of a semiconductor chip 1, showing a portion to be anode-junctioned, the central portion of the inner lead 4a having a width of W3 in FIG. 3 being cut away longitudinally.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 4, numeral 2 depicts a rectangular parallelepiped electrode having a side width of W2 and a height of h. Around this electrode 2 there is formed a square opening section having a side of W2n.
      <br/>
      The insulating coat 2a is adhered onto a portion other than this opening section on the semiconductor chip 1.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, a gap of W2n-W2 is produced between the electrode 2 and the insulating coat 2a.
      <br/>
      A chain line portion indicated by a dimension h denotes a vertical dimension of the electrode 2 before being pressed and deformed by the inner lead 4a at the anode junction, the top thereof protruding by  DELTA h from the insulating coat 2a surface.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, the insulating coat 2a is adhered onto the semiconductor chip surface to have a thickness of (h- DELTA h).
    </p>
    <p num="66">
      Furthermore, when the anode junction is completed and the electrode 2 is pressed, the electrode 2, as shown by a solid line in FIG. 4, has a height of (h- DELTA h).
      <br/>
      When being pressed, the electrode 2 is crushed so that its transverse dimension naturally becomes wider, while, since a space W2n-W2 exists between the electrode 2 and the insulating coat 2a, the increase in this dimension does not affect the insulating coat 2a.
    </p>
    <p num="67">
      However, when the electrode 2 is actually pressed so that a compression strain of  DELTA h/h occurs, the increasing quantity  DELTA W in the width W2 of the electrode 2 is  DELTA W=v * ( DELTA h/h).
      <br/>
      At this time the Poisson ratio v of the electrode 2 is on the order of approximately 0.3, so that, if the increasing quantity  DELTA W can be treated at the designing stage so that it can be disregarded, it will be possible to set as W2n=W2 is possible.
      <br/>
      In fact, the portion at which the inner lead 4a and the insulating coat 2a are anode-junctioned with each other is in the range of the anode-junctioning areas l1 and l2 between which the opening section with the width W2n is interposed.
      <br/>
      Next, a detailed description will be made with reference to FIG. 5 in regard to the anode junctioning force produced in the anode-junctioning areas l1 and l2 and the reaction force generated in the electrode 2.
      <br/>
      FIG. 5 is an illustration for describing the relationship between the anode junctioning force Ffab occurring against the insulating coat 2a and the reaction force Fe1 taking place from the electrode 2.
      <br/>
      The size of the electrode 2 is designed so that the magnitude of the anode junctioning force Ffab becomes larger as compared with the reaction force Fel produced as a reaction due to the electrode compression (Ffab&gt;Fel), where the reaction force Fel is always made to be exposed to the static simple compression.
    </p>
    <p num="68">
      Furthermore, since the anode-junctioning areas l1 and l2 are not equal to each other, although in FIG. 5 the reaction force Fel is not illustrated as occurring at the center of the total anode junctioning force Ffab, ideally it is desirable that Fel occurs at the center of Ffab, that is the electrode 2 is at the center of the anode junctioning portion of the inner lead 4a.
      <br/>
      If design permits the electrode 2 to be subjected to a moment and compression, the Fel can be set to a portion other than the center of Ffab.
    </p>
    <p num="69">When anode-junctioned, the reaction force Fel occurring in the electrode 2 is expressed as Fel=Ex( DELTA h/h) * W2 * W2 which is proportional to  DELTA h/h where E represents an elastic modulus (Young's modulus) depending upon the physical property (property of matter) of the material of the electrode 2.</p>
    <p num="70">
      The anode junctioning force Ffab is the actually measured result of the tensile breaking strength of the junction surface made when a boro-silicate glass being the insulating coat 2a and a silicon are junctioned with each other.
      <br/>
      The boro-silicate glass and the silicon are strongly junctioned with each other to the extent that the glass base material is broken.
      <br/>
      The anode junctioning strength is considered ofab  &gt;= 4 kgf/mm2, and the junctioning force Ffab due to the anode junction becomes +W3 * (l1+W2n+l2)-W2n * W2n} * ofab.
      <br/>
      Now, considering the ratio Ffab/Fel of the anode junctioning force to the reaction force, this value must become greater than 1. the ratio Ffab/Fel can be expressed in accordance with the following equation.
    </p>
    <p num="71">Ffab/Fel=�ofab * +W3 * (l1+W2n+l2)-W2n * W2n}�/ �E * ( DELTA h) * W2 * W2�  (1)</p>
    <p num="72">When aluminium is employed as the material of the electrode 2, if E=6300 kgf/mm2, Ffab/Fel can be expressed by the following equation.</p>
    <p num="73">Ffab/Fel=�4 * +W3 * (l1+W2n+l2)-W2n * W2n}�/ �6300 * ( DELTA h) * W2 * W2�  (2)</p>
    <p num="74">Since the breaking strength of the electrode 2 is 7 kgf/mm2, if the displacement of the electrode 2 is limited to within the plastic deformation area when the electrode 2 is subjected to a compressing force, the value obtainable as  DELTA h/h becomes below less than 1.1 * 103. Accordingly, the breaking strength is doubled to give some allowance, and when the dimension of each part is determined as  DELTA h/h =5 * 10-4, Ffab/Fel is given as follows.</p>
    <p num="75">Ffab/Fel=1.27 * +W3 * (l1+W2n+l2)-W2n * W2n}/+W2 * W2}  (3)</p>
    <p num="76">Since W3 &gt;= W2n &gt;= W2, if W3, W2n and W2 are almost equal to each other, the minimum Ffab/Fel can be obtained from the following equation.</p>
    <p num="77">Ffab/Fel=�1.27 * +(l1+W2n+l2)/W2}-1}�&gt;1  (4)</p>
    <p num="78">
      Accordingly, the only requirement is that the above-mentioned condition be satisfied.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 4, it is possible for (l1+W2n+l2) to be set greater than W2.
    </p>
    <p num="79">In this embodiment, if W3, l1+l2+W2n and W2 are determined so as to satisfy the above-mentioned condition, when in an aluminium electrode  DELTA h/h is set to 5 * 10-4 from the relation of (W2n-W2)/W2 &gt;= v *  DELTA h/h, there results in W2n&gt;1.000165 * W2=W2+1.65 * 10-4 * W2 from v * 0.33. When W2n is set to be greater than W2, the dimension of W2n becomes 1.65 * 10-4 times W2, and hence the only requirement is that the opening section be formed to have a dimension smaller than the dimension of the electrode 2.</p>
    <p num="80">Employing  DELTA h/h=5 * 10-4, the thickness of the insulating coat 2a needs to be h- DELTA h=0.9995 * h. Generally, when the thickness of the insulating coat 2a is set to 25  MU m, the design is satisfactory when the height of the electrode is set to h=25.0125  MU m, and it is higher by 125 angstroms than the height of the insulating coat 2a.</p>
    <p num="81">
      In the above,  DELTA h/h is designed to be within the plastic deformation area of the material of the electrode 2 and the dimension is determined so that  DELTA h/h=5 * 10-4.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, since the difference between the heights of the insulating coat and the electrode is as small as 25 * 5 * 10-4, the height of the electrode 2 must be accurately.
    </p>
    <p num="82">When an electrode 2 is used exceeding the plastic deformation area, since the height of the electrode is adjustable by lowering the accuracy during manufacture, the contact surface of the electrode 2 may have a spheroidal configuration as shown in FIG. 6A or trapezoidal shape as shown in FIG. 6B. Further, it is also appropriate than as shown in FIGS. 7A, 7B and 8 a spheroidal soft conductor (for example, solder) is placed on the electrode surface so that the inner lead and the electrode are electrically connected to each other through the soft conductor, which will be described hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="83">
      FIG. 8 is an plan view of the semiconductor chip 1 in the case that W3&gt;W2 is set so that the Ffab/Fel from the following equation is 1 or more

      For increasing the value of Ffab/Fel, it is effective that W2 is set to be as small as possible and W3 is set to be as large as possible.

      FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view taken along line A--A in FIG. 8 and FIG. 10 is a cross-sectional view taken along line B--B in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      Although in FIGS. 8 to 10 the center of the inner lead 4a in the longitudinal direction is coincident with the junction center of the electrode 2 on the semiconductor chip 1 surface in the anode junctioning process, in the assembly process it is necessary to take the variations of the central line B--B and the central line A--A in to consideration.
      <br/>
      The dimension of each part is determined taking in to account the fact that the electrode 2 can not deviate from the anode junctioning range of the inner lead 4a even if such assembly errors take place, the electrode 2.
      <br/>
      In FIGS. 8 to 10, Ffab and Fel are obtained under the condition that the dimension of one side of the electrode 2 is taken as W2=50  MU m, the dimension of one side of the opening section is taken to be W2n=51  MU m, the thickness of the insulating coat 2a is h- DELTA h=25  MU m, the width of the inner lead 4a is W3=300  MU m, the dimension of one anode junctioning area is set to be l2=400  MU m, and the dimension of the other anode junctioning area is set to be l1=400  MU m.
    </p>
    <p num="85">
      As a result, the anode junctioning force Ffab=1.01 kgf and the reaction force Fel due to the electrode compression equals Fel=7.88 gf. At this time, the surface pressure of the contact surface of the electrode 2 is 3.15 kgf/mm2, which may be satisfactory in obtaining the electrical conduction.
      <br/>
      Moreover, this results in Ffab/Fel =128.2, thus making possible a sufficient functioning force.
      <br/>
      Although in FIG. 10 the anode junctioning section lengths l2 and l1 are different from each other and there is only one electrode 2, it is naturally possible to use a plurality of electrodes.

      FIG. 11 is a plan view of a semiconductor chip viewed from the upper side, showing a state in which inner leads 4a and the semiconductor chip 1 are joined to each other according to the anode junction method.

      As is obvious from this illustration, the tip portion of the inner leads 4a extends to cross over the electrode 2 on the surface of the semiconductor chip 2.
      <br/>
      Further, the anode junction is made at the tip portion of the inner lead 4a painted out.
      <br/>
      In comparison with the junction between the inner lead 4 and the semiconductor chip 2 arising from the conventional wire bonding method as shown in FIG. 49, it is easily understood that the anode junction method according to this embodiment does not require the gold line 5, die pad 41 or suspended lead 42.

    <p num="87">
      FIG. 12 illustrates the electrodes 2 placed on the semiconductor 1 surface and the insulating coat 2a in which opening sections are formed around the electrodes 2.
      <br/>
      It is to be noted that whole the surface of the semiconductor chip 1 onto which the insulating coat 2a is to adhered is an anode-junction allowable area, and it is possible to use even the anode-junction allowable area freely with no insulating coat 2a if required.

    <p num="88">Second Embodiment</p>
    <p num="89">
      Although in the above-described first embodiment the contact surface of the electrode 2 with the inner lead 4a is formed to have a spheroidal or trapezoidal configuration, the configuration of the electrode 2 contact surface can take a pyramidal configuration or variable configurations made by using the side etch during formation by etching as log as the conditions described above are implemented offering the same effects.
      <br/>
      The only requirement is that the electrical contact area between the inner lead 4a and the electrode 2 will assume at least a necessary minimum value when the anode junction is completed.
      <br/>
      For example, as shown in FIG. 6B the contact portion of the electrode 2 to be crushed by the junction would deform to exceeding the plastic area as indicated by a dotted line, however, this is outputted as long as there is electrical conduction therebetween.

    <p num="90">
      If the selection of the material of the electrode 2 is made properly, even if the electrode 2 is subjected to the plastic deformation, it is possible to normally maintain the electrical connection between the electrode 2 and the inner lead 4a.

      Even in the worst case a stable junction is obtainable as compared with the wire bonding method in which the gold line 5 is melted and the melted gold line 5 is re-joined with the aluminium electrode.
      <br/>
      The reason is that the mechanical junction between the inner lead 4a and portions other than the electrode 2 can be made with a sufficient strength because of the anode junction.
    </p>
    <p num="91">Third Embodiment</p>
    <p num="92">Although in the above-described first embodiment the contact surface of the electrode 2 is formed to have a spheroidal or trapezoidal configuration, in order to secure a large crushed amount  DELTA h between the insulating coat 2a and the electrode 2, it is effective to provide a conductive small ball (sphere) 2A made of gold, solder or the like which has a low elastic modulus is provided on the electrode 2 as shown in FIG. 7A. In the illustration, reference numeral 2B indicates a state in which the small ball 2A is crushed by an inner lead, not shown, in anode junction so that the inner lead and the electrode 2 are junctioned with each other to make a conductive state therebetween.</p>
    <p num="93">
      In FIG. 7A, the electrode 2 protrudes from the silicon substrate at the opening section of the insulating coat 2a, while in FIG. 7B the electrode 2 is exposed from the silicon substrate surface and positioned to be lower by (h- DELTA h) than the insulating coat 2a surface, with the result that a sphere 2C having a diameter greater than that of the conductive small ball 2A in FIG. 7A by a size corresponding to the thickness of the electrode 2a can be fitted in the opening section.
      <br/>
      Assuming that a configuration 2D of the crushed sphere 2C is a cylinder having a radius R and height (h- DELTA h), the relationship to the conductive ball  SIGMA  can be expressed by the following equation.  (Equation image '1' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="94">
      If the radius r of the small sphere 2C is set to be equal to the thickness (h- DELTA h) of the insulating coat 2a, the radius R of the configuration 2D of the crushed small sphere 2C becomes R=1.155 * r. That is, the fitted small sphere 2C having a radius r becomes larger by only 15.5% in radius when being crushed.
      <br/>
      Thus, the thickness (h- DELTA h) of the insulating coat 2c can be produced without improving manufacturing accuracy.
    </p>
    <p num="95">
      Furthermore, the dimension W2n of the electrode opening section of the insulating coat 2a need only to be larger than the radius R of the small sphere, and the variation in the radius R of the configuration 2D can be found on the basis of the radius r of the ball 2C and the thickness (h- DELTA h) of the insulating coat 2a.
      <br/>
      That is
      <br/>
      (4/3) PI r3 =(h- DELTA h) *  PI  * R2  (A)

    <p num="98">
      thus the following equation (C) can be given by taking the ratio of (B) and (A),
      <br/>

    <p num="100">
      The rate of change of the radius of a surface to be electrically joined can be expressed by the right side of (D) obtained by developing the equation (C).
      <br/>
      That is, when  DELTA r/r= +- 10% and  DELTA (h- DELTA h)/(h- DELTA h)= +- 10%,  DELTA R/R is only changed by 6.7%, which allows an electrical connection with high accuracy.
      <br/>
      In other words, even if the manufacturing accuracy of the small sphere 2C and the insulating coat 2a are respectively 10%, the error in the radius of the portion to be used for the electrical connection after crushing is as small as 6.7%.
    </p>
    <p num="101">
      In the above equation (A), the volume of the small sphere is given as (4/3)  PI  r3 =VBcm and VBcm / PI  * (h- DELTA h)=R2.

      When the volume of the small sphere varies and the dimension (h- DELTA h) of the insulating coat includes an error,  DELTA R/R is expressed by the following equation.
      <br/>
      DELTA R/R=1/2 PI  * + DELTA VBall /VBall -+ DELTA (h- DELTA h)/(h- DELTA h)}  (E)
    </p>
    <p num="102">
      Accordingly, even if the small sphere VBall does not have a true spherical configuration, as long as it is a conductive inclusion with the necessary volume, this it may be a bump, laminated electrode, or conductive material protruding from the lead frame toward the electrode 2 according to this invention.
      <br/>
      The point is that a conductive material substituting for the small sphere VBall be fitted in between the electrode 2 and the inner lead 4a.
      <br/>
      This can offer the same effect.

    <p num="103">
      Although a description has been made with reference to FIGS. 6A to 7B in terms of an electrode 2 with ideal dimensions, when actually anode-junctioned, the reaction force Fel of the electrode 2 is large, and when the electrode 2 is not crushed  DELTA h by means of the inner lead 4a, a non-junctioned portion can appear in the anode-junctioned area.
      <br/>
      However, when the area for the anode junction is sufficiently wide, even if the non-junctioned portion with the inner lead takes place near the electrode 2, the junctioned portion can maintain the mechanical strength between the inner lead 4a and the semiconductor chip 1.
      <br/>
      In this case,  DELTA h can be set in an ordinary way without taking the accuracy of  DELTA h into consideration.

      Although the conductive inclusion for the electrode section has been described above as being a small sphere 2A or 2C having a completely spherical configuration as illustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B, if the condition mentioned in the third embodiment is satisfied, an irregularly configured body such as a rectangular parallelpiped and cube can produce the same effect.
      <br/>
      Further, the material of the irregularly configured body can be an easily stretchable material such as aluminium, solder and gold or a liquid conductive material such as mercury, and a conductive resin.
      <br/>
      However, when the material of the semiconductor chip is silicon or GaAs, the semiconductor chip will be broken if the conductive inclusion is made of a material having an elastic modulus higher than that of such materials, for which reason it is preferable that the conductive inclusion be made of a material having an elastic modulus lower than that of the material of the semiconductor chip.
      <br/>
      In addition, it is also possible to use a conductive resin or the like other than a metal.

      In this case, it is undesirable to use a material which, when crushed, is stretched so that its dimension exceeds the dimension W2n of the opening section in the insulating coat 2a.

      FIG. 13 is a partially enlarged view of the semiconductor chip 1 surface for describing the fact that, when the junction method according to this embodiment is employed, the pitch of the adjacent electrodes 2, which has been determined depending upon the dimensions of the electrode 2, can be made smaller to allow the chip to be made small.
      <br/>
      The description will be made in terms of the dimension A between wiring conductors 21 in FIG. 13 and the dimension A in FIG. 51 resulting from the conventional junction method.
      <br/>
      In FIG. 51, the pitch A of the electrodes 2 depends upon the dimension D of the electrode 2 and the dimension E of the opening section.
      <br/>
      On the other hand, if the inner lead 4a and the semiconductor chip 1 are joined with each other according to the anode junction of this embodiment, the dimensions B and D of the electrode 2 and the dimensions C and E of the opening section indicated in FIG. 13 can be made smaller.
      <br/>
      This results from the fact that the dimension A between the inner leads 4a can be reduced extremely.
      <br/>
      Since reducing the dimensions B and D is possible, the electrode 2 requires only a minimum area for permitting the electrical junction, and there is no need for a large area to be insured in order to enhance the mechanical junction with the inner lead 4a.
    </p>
    <p num="107">
      The relationship between the area of the electrodes 2 and the anode junctioning area of all the inner leads will be described hereinbelow with reference to FIGS. 13, 8 and 12.

      In FIG. 12, the area of the insulating coat 2a to be anode-junctioned on the semiconductor chip is +W3 * (l1+W2n+l2)-W2n * W2n} when using dimensions l1, l2, W3, W2n and W2 shown in FIG. 8.
      <br/>
      The number of anode junctioning portions is 19 corresponding to the number (19) of the electrodes 2, and hence the total area of the insulation coat 2a to be anode-junctioned is 19 * +W3 * (l1+W2n+l2)-W2n * W2n}. The area of each of the electrodes 2 is 19 * W2n * W2n, and if the area of the electrode 2 is reduced, the area of the anode junctioning area becomes larger, and the mechanical junctioning force Ffab also becomes larger.
      <br/>
      The dimension W2n determining the area of the electrode 2 is equivalent to the dimension D shown in FIG. 13, and therefore, as the dimension becomes smaller, the dimension A can be reduced.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, reducing the dimension W2n or D is the most important factor to reduce the size of the semiconductor chip and to achieve the purpose of enhancing the mechanical junctioning force Ffab.

      In addition, since external leads 44 can be directly bent downwardly at the edge portion of the semiconductor chip 1, the configuration of the semiconductor device can be reduced by the size corresponding to the unnecessary molding resin.

      In FIG. 35C, although the tip portions of the inner leads designated at 4a are not shown to come approach to the central portion, this is to facilitate the comparison with the conventional inner leads shown in FIG. 42.

      As shown in FIG. 35A, the die pad 41 and the suspended leads 42 for supporting the die pad 41 are unnecessary, with the result that the separation between the inner leads can be made larger.

      At this time, all the wiring conductors are short-circuited at the time of the formation of the wiring pattern so as to be subjected to the positive potential of the direct-current power supply voltage.
      <br/>
      After the anode junction, they are released from the short-circuited state.
    </p>
    <p num="157">
      After the respective potentials are prepared for the application, while the junctioning portions 44a are heated, the direct-current power supply voltage causes a positive current to flow from the wiring conductors to the metallic plate 90 so that the anode junction is made between the junctioning surface of the junctioning portions 44 and the wiring conductors.
      <br/>
      As a result, electrostatic adhesive strength and electrochemical bonding strength are generated between the area A and the wiring conductor to accomplish the anode junction therebetween, and the area B and the wiring conductor are electrically junctioned with each other due to the anode junction.
      <br/>
      When being electrically joined, the junctioning surface of the area B is constructed so as to the plastically deform, and the junctioning portions 44a are pressure-joined with the wiring conductor by the force generated when deformed.
    </p>
    <p num="158">In the case that the semiconductor chip 1 and the inner leads 4a are anode-junctioned with each other, the area of the entire surface of the semiconductor chip 1 in which the electrodes 2 are disposed is defined as the area B, and the surface other than the electrode 2 disposed area is defined as the area A.</p>
    <p num="159">Fourteenth Embodiment</p>
    <p num="160">
      In the forgoing embodiment, as described with reference to FIGS. 37A and 37B, a jig is provided which is made such that the external lead 44 is used as the cathode and the wiring conductor is used as the anode for the anode junction between the external lead 44 and the wiring conductor.
      <br/>
      However, it is also possible that by using such a jig an anode junction is made between the external lead 44 of the semiconductor chip 1 and the wiring conductor with the external lead 44 being used as the anode and the wiring conductor being used as the cathode.
      <br/>
      In this case, an insulating coat 2a is adhered onto substantially half of 10 upper and lower external lead connecting portions patterned, for example, on the laminated insulating substrate 70 shown in FIG. 36, which in turn, are connected to an electrically insulating film 76' indicated by hatching.
      <br/>
      At this time, the insulating coat 4a is adhered onto the electrically insulating film 76'.
    </p>
    <p num="161">
      Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 37A, the junctioning portions 44a of the semiconductor chip 1 are placed on the external lead connecting portions, and the junctioning portions 44a are pressed by the metallic plate 90.
      <br/>
      At this time, while a positive potential is applied to the metallic plate 90 and a negative potential is applied to the insulating coat 4a of the wiring insulating substrate 70, the wiring insulating substrate 70 is heated, whereby the junctioning surface of the external lead 44 and the external lead connecting portion are anode-junctioned with each other.
      <br/>
      When a projection is formed at a portion of the external lead connecting portion onto which the insulating coat is not adhered, the electrical connection is improved between the junctioning surface of the external lead 44 and the external lead connection portion in the anode junction.
    </p>
    <p num="162">Fifteenth Embodiment</p>
    <p num="163">
      Although in FIGS. 37A and 37B the external leads 44 extend to cross over the periphery of the semiconductor chip 1 and the junctioning portions 44a which are the tip portions thereof are anode-junctioned with the wiring conductors, it is also appropriate that portion of the inner lead 4a other than the portion to be anode-junctioned (hatched portion) be cut off and the surface of the inner lead 4a remaining on the semiconductor chip 1 be anode-junctioned with the corresponding wiring conductor.
      <br/>
      As a result, the mounting area of the circuit can be enlarged by the extension of the external lead 44.

      As another application example, there is a method in which, in the semiconductor based on the current wire bonding method, a chip is anode-junctioned with a die pad portion of a lead frame.
      <br/>
      This method is classified into a method in which an insulating coat is adhered onto the rear surface of the semiconductor chip and the anode junction is made with the semiconductor chip side being used as the cathode and the die pad section being used as the anode, and a method in which an insulating coat 2a is adhered onto a surface of a frame die pad section and the anode junction is carried out with the lead frame die pad section being used as the cathode and the semiconductor chip side being used as the anode.

      If the anode junction is used in mounting a semiconductor device with a ball grid array on a wiring substrate, there results in the effect that the mounting work can be made simple.
      <br/>
      FIG. 38A is a perspective view showing a semiconductor device using a ball grid array in place of an external connecting lead.
      <br/>
      FIG. 38B is a perspective view showing the bottom surface of the semiconductor device.
      <br/>
      Ball-like bumps B are disposed on the bottom surface to take a matrix configuration.
      <br/>
      These bumps B are connected to electrodes on the semiconductor chip 1.
    </p>
    <p num="168">
      FIG. 38C is a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor device shown in FIG. 38A. The bumps B are coupled to the electrodes on the semiconductor chip 1 through gold lines 5.
      <br/>
      In addition, an insulating coat 2a which has a slight conductive property when being heated is adhered onto the bottom surface of the semiconductor device, and further the surfaces of the bumps B protrude several microns from the film surface of the insulating coat 2a.
      <br/>
      Accordingly, when the anode junction is made between the wiring conductors and the insulating coat 2a after the bumps B are positioned on the wiring conductors on the wiring substrate, the bumps B and the corresponding wiring conductors are electrically connected to each other.
      <br/>
      As a result, it is possible to surely mount a semiconductor device, even having a large-scale ball grid array, on a wiring substrate in a short period of time.
