      A system and method for marking a chip-scale package is disclosed.
      <br/>
      In one aspect, the chip-scale package includes a semiconductor die.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die has an exposed portion substantially surrounded by the first coating.
      <br/>
      In this aspect, the method and system include applying a second coating to a first portion of the first coating and marking the second coating.
      <br/>
      The first coating is not completely penetrated by the marking.
      <br/>
      In a second aspect, the method and system include providing a chip-scale package.
      <br/>
      In this aspect, the method and system comprise providing a substrate, providing a semiconductor die coupled to a substrate, and providing a first coating.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die has an exposed portion.
      <br/>
      The exposed portion is substantially surrounded by the first coating.
      <br/>
      In this aspect, the method and system further include providing a second coating substantially covering a first portion of the first coating.
      <br/>
      The second coating has a plurality of markings therein.
      <br/>
      The first coating is not completely penetrated by the plurality of markings.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">The present invention relates to chip scale packages and more particularly to a method and system for marking the chip scale package.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      Chip-scale packages are used in a variety of semiconductor applications.
      <br/>
      Chip-scale packages typically include a semiconductor die, or chip, mounted on a substrate.
      <br/>
      The active area of the semiconductor die includes the circuitry used to perform the desired functions.
      <br/>
      As their name suggests, chip-scale packages are on the order of the size of a semiconductor die contained within the package.

      In order to designate the manufacturer, part type, and other information, the chip-scale packages are typically marked.
      <br/>
      Because of the amount of information carried in the marking and the size of a chip-scale package, the characters used in the mark are typically relatively fine.
      <br/>
      Typically, a laser is used to cut into a portion of the silicon on the exposed portion of the die.
      <br/>
      Thus, a user is able to read information on the chip-scale package relating to the manufacturer, the part type, and other information relating to the device.

    <p num="4">
      One problem with chip-scale devices is damage due to electrostatic charging.
      <br/>
      When contact is made to the chip-scale package, the electrostatically induced charge may cause a spark.
      <br/>
      The spark may pass through a substantial portion of the semiconductor die, damaging the active area of the semiconductor die and causing failures in the chip-scale package.
    </p>
    <p num="5">
      Recently, a mechanism for reducing the damage induced by electrostatic sparking has been discovered.
      <br/>
      A nonconductive coating, such as an electrophoretic coating, is applied to the semiconductor die of the chip-scale package.
      <br/>
      In order to maintain the small size of the chip-scale package, the coating is applied in a thin layer.
      <br/>
      With the exception of the surface of the die which will contact the substrate, the coating substantially covers the semiconductor die.
      <br/>
      Once the semiconductor die is attached to the substrate, the chip-scale package has a reduced tendency to spark due to electrostatic charging.
      <br/>
      Thus, the failures due to sparking are reduced.
    </p>
    <p num="6">
      Although failures are reduced, conventional methods of marking of the chip-scale package are problematic.
      <br/>
      Conventional laser marking may destroy portions of the coating.
      <br/>
      As a result, benefits due to the coating will be lost.
      <br/>
      Even in an uncoated chip-scale package, laser marking may damage the active area, causing failures in the device.
      <br/>
      Failures may be caused in the chip-scale package for similar reasons if a conventional method for marking the chip-scale package is used.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      Accordingly, what is needed is a system and method for marking a chip-scale package having a thin nonconductive coating.
      <br/>
      The present invention addresses such a need.

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="11">
      The present invention relates to an improvement in chip-scale packages.
      <br/>
      The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements.
      <br/>
      Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the generic principles herein may be applied to other embodiments.
      <br/>
      Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.
    </p>
    <p num="12">
      FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional chip-scale package 10.
      <br/>
      The conventional chip-scale package 10 includes a semiconductor die 12 having and a substrate 16.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die 12 has an active 14 on which circuitry is fabricated.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die 12 also has an exposed surface on which markings 18 are made.
      <br/>
      The conventional markings 18 are typically made by using a laser (not shown) to cut a groove in the surface of the semiconductor die 12.
      <br/>
      Consequently, information such as part number and manufacturer can be carried on the chip-scale package 10.
    </p>
    <p num="13">
      The conventional chip-scale package 10 is subject to electrostatic charging.
      <br/>
      As a result, when contact is made to the conventional chip-scale package 10, a spark may be generated.
      <br/>
      The spark may pass through a substantial portion of the semiconductor die 12, causing damage to circuits in the active area 14.
      <br/>
      Thus, failures in the chip-scale package 10 are induced.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      FIG. 2 depicts a chip-scale package 20 having a thin insulating, highly resistive coating 28.
      <br/>
      The chip-scale package 20 includes a semiconductor die 22 having an active area 24.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die 22 is affixed to a substrate 26.
      <br/>
      The coating 28 is preferably an electrophoretic coating.
      <br/>
      The coating may be on the order of twenty to thirty microns thick.
      <br/>
      The coating 28 is thin in part to ensure that the size of the chip-scale package 20 remains small.
      <br/>
      Because of the coating 28, electrostatic charging and damage due to sparking are reduced.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the chip-scale package 20 is more reliable.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      It is desirable to mark the semiconductor die 22 of the chip-scale package 20 in order to carry information.
      <br/>
      FIG. 3A depicts a conventional method for marking the chip-scale package 20 having a thin insulating coating 28.
      <br/>
      The coating 28 for the chip-scale package 20 is applied via step 32.
      <br/>
      The chip-scale package 20 is then marked via step 34.
      <br/>
      In order to mark the chip-scale package 20, a laser is typically used to burn a groove into the chip-scale package 20.
      <br/>
      Note that other methods of marking the chip-scale package 20, such as inking the chip-scale package 20, may not function because the ink characters (not shown) cannot be formed with sufficient resolution to carry the desired amount of information on the chip-scale package 20.
    </p>
    <p num="16">Although a laser can mark the chip-scale package 20 with sufficient resolution, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that marking the chip-scale package 20 not only removes the benefits of the coating 28, but may also damage the active area 24 of the chip-scale package 20.</p>
    <p num="17">
      For example, FIG. 3B is a diagram of the chip-scale package 20 after conventional laser marking has been performed.
      <br/>
      The laser marking penetrated the coating 28 in areas 27 and 29.
      <br/>
      This occurs because typical laser marking penetrates to a depth on the order of one hundred microns.
      <br/>
      The coating 28 is, however, on the order of twenty to thirty microns.
      <br/>
      Because portions of the coating 28 have been eroded, the coating 28 is no longer able to protect the semiconductor die 22 from sparks generated due to electrostatic charge.
      <br/>
      Thus, the benefits gained by applying the coating in step 32 of the method 30 are lost by marking the semiconductor die 22 in step 34 of the method 30.
      <br/>
      Moreover, conventional marking performed in the absence of the coating 28 may cause damage to the active area 24.
      <br/>
      This occurs because the energy of the laser may penetrate relatively deeply into the semiconductor die 22.
      <br/>
      Thus, the chip-scale package 20 is also subject to the same type of damage which may occur in the chip-scale package 10 without the coating 28.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      The present invention provides a method and system for marking a chip-scale package.
      <br/>
      In one aspect, the chip-scale package includes a semiconductor die.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die has an exposed portion substantially surrounded by the first coating.
      <br/>
      In this aspect, the method and system comprise applying a second coating to a first portion of the first coating and marking the second coating.
      <br/>
      The first coating is not completely penetrated by the marking.
      <br/>
      In a second aspect, the method and system comprise providing a chip-scale package.
      <br/>
      In this aspect, the method and system comprise providing a substrate, providing a semiconductor die coupled to a substrate, and providing a first coating.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die has an exposed portion.
      <br/>
      The exposed portion is substantially surrounded by the first coating.
      <br/>
      In this aspect, the method and system further comprise providing a second coating substantially covering a first portion of the first coating.
      <br/>
      The second coating has a plurality of markings therein.
      <br/>
      The first coating is not completely penetrated by the plurality of markings.
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Because the marking does not penetrate the first coating, the benefits of the first coating are preserved.
      <br/>
      Thus, where the first coating is a highly resistive, insulating coating, damage to due sparking of electrostatic charge is reduced.
      <br/>
      At the same time, the chip-scale package in accordance with the present invention can be marked to carry information useful to the user or manufacturer.
    </p>
    <p num="20">
      The present invention will be described in terms of a chip-scale package using particular coatings.
      <br/>
      However, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that this method and system will operate effectively for other types of coatings and other packages.
    </p>
    <p num="21">
      To more particularly illustrate the method and system in accordance with the present invention, refer now to FIG. 4 depicting a flow chart of one embodiment of a method 100 in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die is coated with a first coating via step 102.
      <br/>
      The first coating is a thin, high resistance, insulating coating.
      <br/>
      A second coating is then applied, via step 104.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the second coating substantially covers the first coating.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the second coating is a tape.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, step 104 is performed by affixing a tape to the semiconductor die.
      <br/>
      Because the tape adheres to the semiconductor die, the tape (the second coating) becomes an integral part of the chip-scale package.
      <br/>
      In one embodiment, the tape is on the order of 20 microns thick.
      <br/>
      Thus, step 104 is performed by applying several layers of tape to form the second coating.
      <br/>
      In a preferred embodiment, step 104 is performed by spraying or spinning the second coating onto the semiconductor die.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the second coating, even if made of many individual layers, is a total of approximately one hundred microns thick.
      <br/>
      The second coating is then marked without completely penetrating the first coating, via step 106.
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      FIG. 5 depicts one embodiment of a chip-scale package 110 fabricated and marked in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The chip-scale package 110 includes a semiconductor die 112 having an active surface 114.
      <br/>
      The chip-scale package 110 also includes a substrate 116 to which the semiconductor die is affixed and a thin, high resistivity insulating coating 118.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first coating is the coating 118.
      <br/>
      The chip-scale package 110 also includes a second coating 120.
      <br/>
      Because of the marking carried out in step 106, the second coating 120 includes grooves 122, 124, and 126.
      <br/>
      The grooves 122, 124, and 126 are part of the markings on the chip-scale package 110.
    </p>
    <p num="23">
      None of the grooves 122, 124, and 126 completely penetrate the first coating 118.
      <br/>
      The shallowest groove 124 does not penetrate the second coating.
      <br/>
      The groove 126 completely penetrates the second coating 118, without substantially affecting the surface of the first coating.
      <br/>
      The deepest groove 122 completely penetrates the second coating, but does not completely penetrate the first coating.
      <br/>
      Consequently, the chip-scale package 110 is marked and retains the benefits provided by the first coating 118.
      <br/>
      Thus, damage to the active area 114 is reduced and sufficient information may be imparted to the user.
    </p>
    <p num="24">
      FIG. 6 depicts a flow chart of another method 130 for marking a chip-scale package in accordance with the present invention.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor die is coated with a first coating via step 132.
      <br/>
      The first coating is a thin, high resistance, insulating coating.
      <br/>
      A second coating is then applied, via step 134.
      <br/>
      Preferably, the second coating substantially covers the first coating.
      <br/>
      A third coating is then applied, via step 136.
      <br/>
      The third coating preferably substantially covers the second coating.
      <br/>
      Also in a preferred embodiment, the third coating can be visually distinguished from the second coating.
      <br/>
      For example, the second coating might be dark colored, and the third coating might be light colored, such as a white molding compound.
      <br/>
      Step 134 and 136 may be performed in a similar manner to step 104 of the method 100.
      <br/>
      The third coating is also preferably on the order of one hundred microns thick.
      <br/>
      Referring back to FIG. 6, the die is then marked without completely penetrating the second coating, via step 138.
      <br/>
      Also in step 138, the third coating is preferably completely penetrated.
    </p>
    <p num="25">
      FIG. 7 depicts one embodiment of a chip-scale package 150 fabricated and marked in accordance with the method 130.
      <br/>
      The chip-scale package 150 includes a semiconductor die 152 having an active surface 154.
      <br/>
      The chip-scale package 150 also includes a substrate 156 to which the semiconductor die is affixed and a thin, high resistivity insulating coating 158.
      <br/>
      Thus, the first coating is the coating 158.
      <br/>
      The chip-scale package 110 also includes a second coating 160 and a third coating 162.
      <br/>
      Because of the marking carried out in step 138, the third coating 120 includes grooves 164, 166, and 186.
      <br/>
      The grooves 164, 166, and 168 are part of the markings on the chip-scale package 150.
    </p>
    <p num="26">
      None of the grooves 164, 166, and 168 completely penetrate the first coating 158 or the second coating 160.
      <br/>
      The shallowest groove 124 does not penetrate the second coating.
      <br/>
      Although not necessary, it is preferable for all of the grooves 164, 166, and 168 to penetrate the third coating.
      <br/>
      Because the second coating 160 and the third coating 162 have different color, the markings composed of the grooves 164, 166, and 168 is relatively easy to see.
      <br/>
      In addition, because the first coating 158 is not penetrated, the chip-scale packages still retain the benefits of the electrophoretic coating.
    </p>
    <p num="27">
      Thus, the chip-scale packages 110 and 150 carry sufficient information in their markings 122, 124, and 126, and 164, 166, and 168, respectively.
      <br/>
      In addition, the marking steps 106 and 138 are performed without completely penetrating the first coating 118 and 158, respectively.
      <br/>
      As a result, damage due to sparking because of electrostatic charging is reduced.
      <br/>
      Thus, reliability of the chip-scale packages is enhanced while the chip-scale packages are capable of carrying information for the user on the markings.
