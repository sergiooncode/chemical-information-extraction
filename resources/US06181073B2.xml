    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">This invention relates generally to microscopes, more particularly to a piezoelectric device for controlling illumination in microscopes, and, even more specifically, to an illumination control circuit comprising a lithium niobate crystal.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      The illumination system is a very important part of a microscope.
      <br/>
      In fact, the full potential of any optical microscope can only be achieved if the microscope is equipped with the proper kind of illumination system.
      <br/>
      Specimen illumination also affects operator comfort and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      It is difficult to determine the best illumination system to achieve optimum illumination, since this depends both on the nature of the specimen to be examined and the type, structure and design of the microscope.
      <br/>
      For example, the illumination problem is compounded in the case of a stereo microscope, which embodies two separate and complete microscopes.
      <br/>
      No single illumination system is suitable for examining all types of specimens.
      <br/>
      Often, different illumination systems are used with the same microscope for different types of specimens.
      <br/>
      Almost always, there is an optimum illumination system for a particular system.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      Various types of illumination systems are known, including, but not limited to the following: Nicholas illuminator, general purpose illuminator, fluorescent illuminator, reflector illuminator, ring illuminator, spot illuminator, coaxial illuminator, eyepiece illuminator, fiber optic annular illuminator, fiber optic bifurcated illuminator, fiber optic four-point illuminator, critical illuminator, and Koehler illuminator.
      <br/>
      Regardless of the type of illuminator, they all have one thing in common - an illumination element.
      <br/>
      Some use incandescent lamps, others fluorescent lamps, and some use fiber optics.
      <br/>
      It is often necessary and/or preferable to vary the intensity of the illumination provided by the light source.
      <br/>
      Often, this is accomplished by varying the voltage applied to the illumination element by way of an electrical rheostat.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, rheostats are relatively expensive and can be bulky.
    </p>
    <p num="5">There is a need, then, for a device for controlling illumination in microscopes and in other devices which does not require an expensive, bulky electrical rheostat.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="6">
      The invention broadly comprises a piezoelectric illumination control circuit for a microscope, comprising a tunable frequency source of alternating current, a piezoelectric crystal having an impedance dependent on operating frequency, driven by the tunable frequency source of alternating current, and, a load driven by the piezoelectric crystal.
      <br/>
      A second embodiment comprises a piezoelectric illumination control circuit for a microscope, comprising a constant frequency source of alternating current, a piezoelectric crystal coupled to a tunable dummy reactive load for the purpose of varying the impedance of the crystal and dummy load, the piezoelectric crystal driven by the constant frequency source of alternating current, and, a load driven by the piezoelectric crystal.
      <br/>
      Although a preferred embodiment of the invention is intended for use in controlling intensity of lamps in microscopes, the circuit of the invention can be used to control loads in other circuits as well.
    </p>
    <p num="7">A primary object of the invention is to provide an economical and efficient circuit for controlling the intensity of a lamp in a microscope.</p>
    <p num="8">A secondary object of the invention is to provide a replacement for a rheostat in a microscope.</p>
    <p num="9">Another object of the invention is to provide a replacement for both a step-down transformer and a rheostat in an illumination control circuit for a microscope.</p>
    <p num="10">A further object of the invention is to provide a replacement for a ballast in a microscope containing a fluorescent lamp.</p>
    <p num="11">These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art from the follow detailed description of the invention in view of the drawings and appended claims.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="13">
      At the outset, it should be understood that the present invention, in a preferred embodiment, is intended as a replacement for a ceramic rheostat in a microscope.
      <br/>
      Ceramic rheostats are commonly used in microscope power supply circuits to control illumination elements.
      <br/>
      Unfortunately, rheostats are relatively expensive and break down more often than solid state devices.
      <br/>
      The present invention eliminates the ceramic rheostat and replaces it with a solid state piezoelectric material.
      <br/>
      Although a wide variety of piezoelectric materials exist which could be used for this purpose, in a preferred embodiment, a lithium niobate crystal was selected due to its high coupling coefficient and ease of availability.
    </p>
    <p num="14">
      The fundamental concept of a first embodiment of this invention involves the relationship of the driving frequency of the electrical power supply to the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric device.
      <br/>
      When the driving frequency of the source is tuned to the resonant frequency of the crystal, the impedance of the crystal is minimized, resulting in a maximum voltage drop across the illuminator or lamp component.
      <br/>
      As the driving frequency varies above or below the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric crystal, the crystal impedance increases, and the corresponding voltage drop across the load decreases, reducing the illumination produced by the lamp.
    </p>
    <p num="15">
      In a second embodiment, a constant drive frequency is applied to the crystal, but the impedance of the crystal is made variable by a coupled tunable dummy load.
      <br/>
      Ideally, the drive frequency is set to equal the known resonant frequency of the crystal.
      <br/>
      The dummy load is reactive, and may be either capacitive or inductive.
      <br/>
      By varying the dummy load, the impedance of the crystal/dummy load combination is varied, thereby varying the voltage applied to the lamp load.
    </p>
    <p num="16">
      A typical prior art power supply circuit is shown in schematic form in FIG. 1.
      <br/>
      The circuit comprises alternating current source S, step-down transformer T1, rheostat RR, and load (lamp) L. Assuming the source produces V1 =120 VAC @ 60 Hz, and the step-down transformer reduces the voltage to V2 =7.5 VAC, the rheostat varies the voltage drop across the load.
      <br/>
      As the rheostat resistance is dialed to a minimum value, Ohm's Law dictates that progressively more voltage appears across the lamp terminals and as the rheostat resistance approaches its minimum value, the lamp approaches its brightest output.
      <br/>
      Conversely, as the rheostat resistance increases, the voltage across the terminals of the lamp decreases and the lamp dims.
    </p>
    <p num="17">
      A first embodiment of the present invention replaces the rheostat with a piezoelectric crystal and associated control circuitry.
      <br/>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the control circuit comprises a source of alternating current S at voltage V1 and frequency f1 (typically 120 or 240 VAC at 60 Hz), step-down transformer T1, which reduces the voltage to V2, chopper circuit MV and Cv1 which increases the driving frequency to f2 (typically of the order 1.65 MHz), lithium niobate crystal LN, and lamp load L. The chopper frequency f2 is nominally set to the resonant frequency of the crystal, and variable capacitor Cv1 tunes multivibrator MV to match the resonant frequency or to produce a frequency above or below the resonant frequency.
      <br/>
      Although a bistable multivibrator is used in a preferred embodiment, other types of chopper devices can be used as well.
      <br/>
      Also, in this first embodiment, a lithium niobate crystal was used and calculations infra are based on the physical constants associated with lithium niobate.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated, however, that other piezoelectric crystals could also be used in the control circuit of the invention.
    </p>
    <p num="18">
      As is well known, the resonant response characteristic as a function of frequency of quartz, lithium niobate, lithium tantalate and a host of other like materials can be modeled as an equivalent circuit.
      <br/>
      In this equivalent circuit model, the static capacitance, Co, of the fundamental unit is added to motional capacitance, CM, inductance, Lm, and resistive Rm terms as shown in FIG. 3. "Introduction to Quartz Crystal Unit Design", Virgil E. Bottom, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1982, pg. 87. where,
    </p>
    <p num="19">
      Rm =motional resistance, typically only a few micro-ohms, usually neglected in calculations
      <br/>
      Cm =motional capacitance
      <br/>
      Lm =motional inductance
    </p>
    <p num="20">For fundamental mode resonance the piezoelectric material will then have an electrical behavior governed by the equations:  (Equation image '1' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="21">
      Where:
      <br/>
      A is the area of the electrode on the piezoelectric device
      <br/>
      t is the blank thickness  EPSILON 0 is the susceptibility of free space, 8.85 * 1012 C2 /N * m2
      <br/>
      k is the dielectric constant
      <br/>
      RHO  is the density of the piezoelectric material
      <br/>
      EPSILON  Is the piezoelectric stress constant of the material
      <br/>
      c is the piezoelectric elastic constant of the material
    </p>
    <p num="22">
      Assuming a blank thickness of 0.0815", corresponding to a nominal resonant frequency of 1.65 MHz, the impedance of the lithium niobate chip as a function of frequency can be calculated as follows.
      <br/>
      The capacitive and inductive reactance terms for the static and motional components are:  (Equation image '2' not included in text)
    </p>
    <p num="23">where the motional inductive reactance is XLm =2 PI .function.Lm</p>
    <p num="24">The impedance of the crystal is then modeled as:  (Equation image '3' not included in text)</p>
    <p num="25">(Equations from "Introduction to Quartz Crystal Unit Design", Virgil E. Bottom, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1982.)</p>
    <p num="26">The response curve as a function of frequency is shown in FIG. 4.</p>
    <p num="27">
      From this example, it is clear that, at resonance, the inductive and capacitive reactance terms exactly cancel each other out and only the ohmic term is left, typically a value of 2 to 6 ohms.
      <br/>
      At the anti-resonance point, the impedance is essentially infinite and as a matter of practice, is usually of the order of several megaohms.
    </p>
    <p num="28">
      An even more practical variant of this concept is to set the frequency of the chopping or frequency conversion circuitry at a convenient value and then simply shift the natural resonance point of the lithium niobate chip by changing the external load.
      <br/>
      In most cases, it is preferred to use a variable external ancillary (dummy) load capacitor as this results in less wasted electrical power dissipation, but an external load inductor could be used as well.
      <br/>
      An example of this second embodiment control circuit using a variable capacitive load is shown in FIG. 5A, and an example using an inductive load is shown in FIG. 5B. In these embodiments, O represents the oscillator which chops the input signal having frequency f1 into a signal having a frequency f2.
      <br/>
      This second frequency is set to approximate the resonant frequency of the crystal LN.
      <br/>
      Varying the capacitive or inductive loads Cv2 and Lv2 in these two circuits functions to dim the lamps.
    </p>
    <p num="29">
      Finally, FIG. 6 illustrates a third embodiment of the control circuit of the invention which replaces both the step-down transformer and the rheostat with a piezoelectric crystal and associated drive circuitry.
      <br/>
      In this embodiment, the lithium niobate chip is configured with a pair of electrodes on one surface and a common electrode on the opposing face.
      <br/>
      The ratio of the surface areas of the two electrodes on the first face determines the step-up or step-down voltage ratio.
    </p>
    <p num="30">
      In this design, as we match the driving electrical frequency to that of the natural resonance frequency of the chip, the electrical coupling from one electrode to its adjacent neighbor becomes more efficient and more voltage appears at the second electrode.
      <br/>
      The lamp is then connected directly to the second electrode and driven without need of wasting electrical power through a passive load in series with it.
    </p>
    <p num="31">
      Adverting now to FIG. 6, the third embodiment circuit comprises source S, current limiting resistor RL, chopper circuit MV and Cv1, lithium niobate crystal LN having first electrode e1, second electrode e2, common electrode ec, and load lamp L. In the circuit shown, the crystal is arranged as a voltage step-down device, with V1 &gt;V2.
      <br/>
      Control of lamp intensity is accomplished by tuning capacitor Cv1 to vary driving frequency f1.
      <br/>
      Again, when the driving frequency matches the resonant frequency of the crystal, the impedance of the crystal is at a minimum, and lamp intensity is at its brightest.
      <br/>
      As the driving frequency varies from the resonant frequency, the impedance increases and the lamp dims.
      <br/>
      It should be appreciated that this circuit could easily be configured to operate as a voltage step-up device by reversing the electrode leads.
      <br/>
      Thus, it is seen that this embodiment replaces both the transformer and rheostat with a piezoelectric crystal and associated drive circuitry.
    </p>
    <p num="32">
      A typical rheostat used in a microscope lamp control circuit costs about $9.00, whereas the cost of the piezoelectric chip and associated circuitry used in the first two disclosed embodiments costs about $2.00, a savings of nearly 75%.
      <br/>
      The savings is even greater for the third embodiment, where the transformer is replaced.
      <br/>
      Moreover, the electronic circuitry is much more reliable and energy efficient than the corresponding rheostat circuit.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      It should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to circuits containing incandescent lamps as loads.
      <br/>
      In a circuit containing a fluorescent lamp, for example, the circuit of the present invention can be used to replace the inductive coil in the ballast circuit with the piezoelectric crystal of the present invention.
      <br/>
      By varying the impedance of the crystal as described earlier, the fluorescent lamp can be dimmed.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Thus it is seen that the objects of the invention are efficiently attained.
      <br/>
      Modifications of the invention should be readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art, and the three disclosed embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed.
