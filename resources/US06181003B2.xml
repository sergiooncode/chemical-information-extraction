    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="1">
      This invention relates to an improvement applicable to a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package and to a method for producing a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package.
      <br/>
      More specifically, this invention relates to an improvement applicable to a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package and a method for production thereof, the improvement being developed to increase the reliability thereof by reducing possibilities in which a solder layer connecting a lead and a foot print of a printed board is cracked, resulting in an incomplete mechanical and electrical connection between a lead and a printed board.
    </p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="2">
      In the wake of the quick development in the technical field of an +character pullout}C, a memory card and the like, requirement to make them thinner and smaller in size is increasingly more severe.
      <br/>
      Such a requirement is directed also to a semiconductor device employable for an +character pullout}C and/or a memory card.
    </p>
    <p num="3">
      Referring to FIG. 1 illustrating a cross section of a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package available in the prior art, a plurality of leads 603 (The leads 603 are arranged on a semiconductor device chip in parallel to one another.) are adhered to the top surface 601a (the surface under which monolithic electronic components are produced and actually the bottom surface in FIG. 1) of a semiconductor device chip 601 by employing an adhesive tape e.g. polyimide resin type 602.
      <br/>
      Each of the leads 603 is bonded with each of bonding pads 104a produced on the top surface of the semiconductor device chip 601, by an Au wire 604.
      <br/>
      The semiconductor device chip 601 provided the leads 603 is molded in a plastic mold e.g. a mold of polyimide resin 605, remaining the top surface of the ends 603a of the leads 603 and the bottom surface 601b of the semiconductor device chip 601 unmolded.
      <br/>
      Although the thickness of the plastic mold 605 is in the range of 0.3-0.4 mm in the vertical direction, it is marginal on the side surface of the semiconductor device chip 601.
      <br/>
      This is for the purpose to make the thickness of a finished semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package thin and to make the horizontal area thereof small.
    </p>
    <p num="4">
      After turning the finished semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package upside down, the ends 603a of the leads 603 are soldered with foot prints 610 arranged on a printed board 610a.
      <br/>
      In this manner, electric connection is secured between the end 603a of the lead 603 and the foot prints 610 by means of a solder lump 611.
    </p>
    <p num="5">Since a semiconductor device chip 601 is mounted on a printed board in an upside-down position, and since the bottom surface thereof is not covered by a plastic mold e.g. a mold of polyimide resin 605 in the prior art, the thickness of a finished semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package is sizably reduced.</p>
    <p num="6">
      The foregoing semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package available in the prior art is, however, involved with a drawback wherein the solder lumps 611 connecting the end 603a of the leads 603 and the foot print 610 arranged on the printed board 610a is inclined to be cracked, resulting in unsatisfactory mechanical and electric connection between the end 603a and the foot print 610.
      <br/>
      This is of course a parameter to degrade the reliability of a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package from electrical and mechanical viewpoints.
    </p>
    <p num="7">
      This adverse phenomenon is assumed to be caused by large difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between a semiconductor device chip and a printed board and by weak connection between a lead 603 and a foot print 610.
      <br/>
      In other words, the length of a lead 603 is designed to be short for the purpose to reduce the horizontal area of a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package.
      <br/>
      Therefore, it is difficult for the lead 603 to absorb a stress derived from a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between a semiconductor device chip and a printed board.
      <br/>
      In addition, a small area of the end 603a of a lead 603 which is caused by the design in which the length of the lead 603 is made short, causes to make the connection strength weak between the end 603a of a lead 603 and the foot print 610.
    </p>
    <p num="8">In the foregoing environments, development of a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package, wherein the connection between a lead and a printed board is strong, thereby the semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package is reliable from electrical and mechanical viewpoints is strongly required.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THIS INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="26">Referring to drawings, a detailed description will be presented below for three semiconductor devices packaged in plastic package and this methods for producing them in accordance with three independent embodiments of this invention.</p>
    <p num="27">
      In the following embodiments, the dimension of a semiconductor device chip is assumed to be 15 mm in length, 6 mm in width and 0.3 mm in thickness.
      <br/>
      The thickness of a plastic mold is assumed to be in the range of 0.3 through 0.4 mm for any embodiment.
      <br/>
      Coefficient of linear expansion is assumed to be 3 * 1031 6 / (degree)  C. for an Si substrate, 4 * 1031 6 / (degree)  C. for a lead made of an alloy containing 42% of Ni and 58% of Fe and 10 * 10-6 / (degree)  C. for a plastic mold made of epoxy resin.
    </p>
    <p num="28">First Embodiment</p>
    <p num="29">A semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package provided with J-shaped leads.</p>
    <p num="30">
      Referring to FIG. 2, each of plural leads made of an alloy containing 42% Ni and 58% Fe and having the coefficient of linear expansion of 4 * 10-6 / (degree)  C. 103 is adhered to the top surface (the rear surface in the drawings) of a semiconductor device chip of which the dimension is 15 mm in length, 6 mm in width and 0.3 mm in thickness 101 by employing an adhesive tape e.g. a polyimide tape 102.
      <br/>
      The leads 103 are arranged in parallel to one another.
      <br/>
      The length of the leads 103 is long enough to allow to be bent.
      <br/>
      The coefficient of linear expansion is 3 * 10-6 / (degree)  C. for an Si substrate of the semiconductor device chip 101 and is 10 * 10-6 / (degree)  C. for epoxy resin.
    </p>
    <p num="31">Referring to FIG. 3, each of the leads 103 is bonded with each of bonding pads 104a produced on the top surface of the semiconductor device chip 101, by an Au wire 104.</p>
    <p num="32">
      Referring to FIG. 4, a molding process is conducted to cover the top and side surfaces of the semiconductor device chip 101.
      <br/>
      The thickness of plastic mold 105 is relatively thin for the purpose to make the horizontal dimension and thickness of a finished semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package small.
      <br/>
      The thickness of the plastic mold 105 is in the range of 0.3 through 0.4 mm. As a result, the end 103a of the lead 103 projects from the plastic mold 105, to the right and left in the drawing.
    </p>
    <p num="33">
      Referring to FIG. 5 the end 103a of each of the leads 103 is bent to allow the end 103a to cover the top surface of the plastic mold 105.
      <br/>
      The end 103a of the leads 103 is not fixed to the top surface of the plastic mold 105.
      <br/>
      In this manner, a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package and provided with J-shaped leads 103 in accordance with a first embodiment of this invention is finished.
    </p>
    <p num="34">
      Referring to FIG. 6, the finished semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package and provided with J-shaped leads is mounted on a printed board 110a in a manner described below.
      <br/>
      The top surface of the ends 103a of the leads 103 are soldered to foot prints 110 produced on the printed board 110a, after the semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package and provided with J-shaped leads is turned upside down.
    </p>
    <p num="35">
      As is shown in FIG. 6, the lead 103 is longer than that of the prior art and has a bow portion or a bent portion 103b between the end 103a and the main body 103c of the lead 103.
      <br/>
      This shape allows a large magnitude of flexibility for the lead 103.
      <br/>
      As a result, potential stress generated and stored in a solder 111 caused by difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the semiconductor device chip and the printed board, is readily absorbed in the lead 103, resultantly decreasing the possibility in which the solder 111 is cracked to cause unsatisfactory mechanical and electrical connection between the lead 103 and the foot print 110.

      It is noted that the coefficient of linear expansion is 3 * 10-6 / (degree)  C. for an Si substrate of the semiconductor device chip 101, 4 * 10-6 / (degree)  C. for the leads 103 made of an alloy containing 42% Ni and 58% Fe and 10 * 10-6 / (degree)  C. for the plastic mold 105 made of epoxy resin.

      It is emphasized that the foregoing shape of the leads 103 is effective also for the purpose to reduce the horizontal dimension of the semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package and provided with J-shaped leads. 4 * 1031 6 / (degree)  C. for the leads 103 made of an alloy 42% Ni and 58% Fe and 10 * 10-6 / (degree)  C. for the plastic mold 165 made of epoxy resin.

      Referring to FIG. 7, each of plural leads 303 is adhered to the top surface (the bottom surface in the drawings) of a semiconductor device chip 301 by employing an adhesive tape e.g. a polyimide tape 302.
      <br/>
      The length of the lead 303 is much shorter than that of the first embodiment.
      <br/>
      Each of the leads 303 is bonded with each of bonding pads 304a produced on the top surface of the semiconductor device chip 301, by employing an Au wire 304.

      Referring to FIG. 8, a molding process is conducted to cover the central area of the top surface of and the side surface of the semiconductor device chip 301.
      <br/>
      Epoxy resin is employed for the plastic mold.
      <br/>
      Attention is paid to make the thickness of a plastic mold 305 produced along the side of the semiconductor device chip 301 thin e.g. 0.3 through 0.4 mm for the purpose to make the horizontal dimension of the semiconductor device small.
      <br/>
      In this molding process, the space between the top surface of the semiconductor device chip 301 and the leads 303 is filled by the plastics or by epoxy resin in this example.
    </p>
    <p num="40">
      Referring to FIG. 9, a part of the leads 303 which is not adhered to the semiconductor device chip 301 by the adhesive tape e.g. polyimide resin tape 302 is peeled from the thin plastic mold 305 produced along the top surface of the semiconductor device chip 301 and folded toward the top surface of the plastic mold 305, resultantly making U-shaped leads 303.
      <br/>
      The end of the leads 303 is not fixed to the top of the plastic mold 305.

      The top surface of the folded ends 303a of the leads 303 are soldered to foot prints 310 produced on the printed board 310a, after the semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package and provided with U-shaped leads is turned upside down.
    </p>
    <p num="42">
      Referring again to FIG. 10, since the lead 303 consists of the folded end 303a, a bent portion 303b and a main body 303c, the lead 303 is fairly flexible.
      <br/>
      As s result, potential stress generated and stored in a solder lump 311 caused by difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the semiconductor device chip 301 and the printed board 310a, is readily absorbed in the lead 303, resultantly decreasing the possibility in which the solder 311 is cracked to cause unsatisfactory mechanical and electrical connection between the lead 103 and the foot print 110.

      <br/>
      In addition, since the leads 303 are arranged exclusively at the central part of the semiconductor device chip 301, the horizontal dimension of the semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package and provided with U-shaped leads is remarkably reduced.

      Referring to FIG. 11, each of plural leads 503 is adhered to the top surface (the rear surface in the drawings) of a semiconductor device chip 501 by employing an adhesive tape e.g. a polyimide tape 502.
      <br/>
      The length of the lead 503 is long.
      <br/>
      In other words, the length of the lead 503 is approximately same as that of the first embodiment.

      Referring to FIG. 13, the ends 503a is bent by 180 (degree)  or folded back starting at the location close to the side surface 505a of the plastic mold 505.
      <br/>
      Attention is paid not to cover the top surface of the plastic mold 505 with the end 503a of the lead 503 for the purpose to make the height of the folded end 503a smaller than that of the top surface 505b of the resin mold 505.
      <br/>
      Produced in this manner is a semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package, the location of the package being limited to the central area of the top surface of a semiconductor device chip, and the semiconductor device being provided with J-shaped leads whose top surface is not higher than the top surface of the package, in accordance with the third embodiment of this invention.

      <br/>
      In addition, since the height of the folded end 503a is smaller than that of the top surface 505b of the resin mold 505, the overall height of the semiconductor device packaged in a plastic package is much smaller than those of the first and second embodiments.
